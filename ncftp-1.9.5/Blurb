NcFTP - Alternative user interface for FTP
Version 1.6.0 by Mike Gleason, NCEMRSoft.

I used to list the features of ncftp in this blurb, but there are just
too many to list.  Even if you only ftp occasionally, it is worth your
time to install ncftp (or atleast bug your sysadmin to).  If you won't take
my word for it, just ask around, or extract this archive and read the
man page.

1.6.0 is an "evolutionary" upgrade, which consolidates all the previous
patches and adds a little.  1.6 and 1.5 are "interim" versions between
2.0 which has been suspended indefinitely due to time constraints.

Major changes since 1.5.6:

* Built-in support for the "term" package, used by Linux, etc.

* SCO Xenix, Besta, AIX 2, AIX 3, Dynix/PTX support

* Better ISC Unix support.

* Several bug fixes.


Major changes since 1.0.2:

* Supports the Getline (input-edit) and GNU Readline command-line
  editing and history libraries.

* Supports the Socks firewall library, and another firewall gateway
  implementation.

* Terrific new "recent-sites" file that automatically saves the
  sites you call;  when you open a site in the recent-sites file
  (of course you can abbreviate the names), you start in the
  same directory you were in last time.

* Improved on-line help, and tips on how to use the program better
  are printed each time you run the program.

* Rewritten man page.

* Faster ascii transfers.

* Typing 'open' by itself lists all the sites the program knows
  about (the ones in your .netrc and the recent-sites list) so
  you can just pick one.

* Enhanced colon-mode, that can dump a file to stdout (ftpcat mode)
  or to a pager.  (i.e. ncftp -c wu:/README >/dev/null).

* You can choose whether an open is anonymous by default (like it
  had always been) or a user login by default by setting a new
  program variable.

* Bugs fixed.

Read the enclosed file, v2_Notes, which explains why I won't be
able to work on the nearly finished, and much improved v2.0.
