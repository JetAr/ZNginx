Compile info (Release):

1. In Visual C++ open webserver.dsw Project workspace

2. Then from Build select Set Active Configuration... 
and choose webserver - Win32 Release and click OK

3. Finaly Build and Build webserver.exe (or press F7)
(one warning about main function should return a value)

Win32 Debug works too, but it generates 261 warnings about STL/STD.
