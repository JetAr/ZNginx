    	Destructor

    	Here it is!  The destructor is an method that every class gets by default.  It
    	is called when ever the object is destroyed.  In general there are two ways an
    	object gets destroyed.  One is way is when you explicitly call "delete" on the object.
    	The other is when the object looses scope.  A scope is formed by a left bracket '{' and
    	a right bracket '}'.  So given this example:

    	void SomeFunction()
    	{ // This starts the scope of the function

    		CStrObj s;

    		s.set("GameTutorials teaches programming through the art of making games");
    		s.print(1);
    	} // This ends the scope.  At this point the local variable 's' would be
    	  // destroyed, thus it's destructor would be called

    	If your class does not have dynamic data, then you can most likely can just use the
    	default destructor.  If you have dynamic data then you MUST implement your own
    	destructor.  Why you ask?  To properly free up the memory that's why.  The destructor's
    	job in life is to destroy stuff.  If you don't overload it, it will have no job
    	and then it will apply for welfare and nobody wants that!

    	The destructor does not take any parameters ever.  It also never returns any
    	parameters.  It looks a lot like the signature for the default constructor
    	except it begins with the tilde character '~'
