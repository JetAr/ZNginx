//***********************************************************************//

#include <iostream>									// Include our standard files
#include <string>									// Include this to use the string class
#include <vector>									// Include this to use the vector class
using namespace std;								// Set the namespace to standard

// When programming, you come across problems all the time that could be
// standard and you wonder why C/C++ didn't come up with something for it.
// Lists are one of those things that we use almost all the time when making
// games.  You would use a list for an inventory, monsters in the room,
// characters in your party, the amount of ammo you hold, polygons in your world...
// There are tons of applications for it.  For those of you who have written
// a link list class over and over again, for every data type you use, I
// have something that will change your world; it's called vectors.
// I don't mean 3D vectors, I mean the STL's (Standard Template Library)
// "vector" class.  This allows you dynamically allocate data with out ever
// touching new, malloc() or realloc().  The vector class is an array
// based link list.  If you want just a link list you can use STL's "list".
// There is also stack and queue.  You will never need to implement your
// own list class again.  These are most likely faster and more efficient
// than anything we could write.  Below I attempt to show you the benefits
// to using the vector class.

// Here we create our own structure for items.  This will be used to
// demonstrate how we could easily create and manage an inventory.
struct tItem
{
    string strName;							// This will hold our item's name
    int weight;								// This will hold our item's weight
};


int main()									// Beginning of the program
{
    // Below we create our first list.  It is a list of integers.
    // To do so, we put the vector class name in front, then we use
    // the less than sign '<' with the list type we want in the middle,
    // and then close it with the greater than sign '>'.  If you have worked
    // with templated classes you will notice this syntax.  After we define
    // the type of list we want, we assign it to a variable name, vIntegers in this case.

    vector<int>		vIntegers;				// Create a list of integers using the vector class

    // Now that we have our list, we don't have anything in it.
    // We want to add an integer to it.  To do so you call the function:
    // push_back().  This function adds a new item to the list on the top.
    // We push back a 5, so now we have a list with the size of 1, with the
    // first index in the list the value 5.  It works just like a stack.
    // Pushing something on puts it on top, and popping something off takes
    // the top one off.  The difference is that we can access any index like an array.

    vIntegers.push_back(5);					// Add an integer to the list with the value 5

    // Here we print out the size (how many items) are in the list.
    // So far we only added one, so this should print out 1 to the screen.
    // To get the size of our list we call the function size().  This makes
    // everything so much easier when dealing with lists.  You don't need to
    // walk the list and count yourself, as well as it being dynamic.

    cout << "The current size of the integer list is: " << vIntegers.size() << endl;

    // Now we want to add more items to our list.  We just call the same function
    // we did up above, push_back(), and pass in the values that we want stored.

    vIntegers.push_back(10);				// Add 10 to our list (List size is now 2)
    vIntegers.push_back(15);				// Add 15 to our list (List size is now 3)
    vIntegers.push_back(20);				// Add 20 to our list (List size is now 4)

    // We should now have a list size of 4 with the values [5 10 15 20] in an array.
    // Instead of passing in constant values, I will demonstrate on how to pass in
    // variables.

    int number = 25;						// Create a variable and set it to 25

    // It works just like any other function, just pass in the variable and it
    // takes it's value and creates another slot to hold that value.

    vIntegers.push_back(number);			// Add 25 to our list (List size is now 5)

    // Here we print out the current size of our list which should be 5
    cout << "The current size of the integer list is: " << vIntegers.size() << "\n\n";

    unsigned int i;									// Create a counter variable

    // Below we print out all of the values in our list.  You can index
    // any value in the list like an array:  vIntegers[3] - (The 4th item in the list)

    // Go through the entire list
    for(i = 0; i < vIntegers.size(); i++)
    {
        // Here we print out the current value in our list of index 'i'
        cout << "vIntegers[" << i << "] is: " << vIntegers[i] << endl;
    }

    // Let's say we want to get rid of some items in our list.
    // To do that we call pop_back().  This destroys the item
    // on top of the list (The last one added on) like a stack does.
    // If we didn't just want the top one removed, we would then
    // just swap the one we wanted removed with the last one in the list,
    // then call pop_back().  Neat huh :)  Or, we could use the erase() function.

    vIntegers.pop_back();					// Remove the item with value 25 from the top
    vIntegers.pop_back();					// Remove the item with value 20 from the top

    // Once again, to demonstrate the awesome power of vectors,
    // we print the size of the list :)  It should be 3 since we just removed 2.
    cout << "\nThe current size of the integer list is: " << vIntegers.size() << "\n\n";

    // To prove we removed the last 2 items, we go through them all again
    for(i = 0; i < vIntegers.size(); i++)
    {
        // Print out the current item and it's value in order from 0
        cout << "vIntegers[" << i << "] is: " << vIntegers[i] << endl;
    }

    // If we want to clear the list, we don't need to pop them all off.
    // We can just call the handy "clear()" function.  Guess what it does?

    vIntegers.clear();						// Reset the list of integers

    // If we print out the size of the list now we should see there is 0 items
    cout << "\nThe current size of the integer list is: " << vIntegers.size() << "\n\n";

    // Working with integers is easy, but let's try something a bit more complicated.
    // Below we create a vector list of tItems.  This is the structure we
    // created above.  It's the same template syntax as working with
    // integers, except we substitute "int" with "tItem" as seen below.
    // There is one thing different though in this case.  We want to start
    // off with 3 items.  We just pass 3 into the class's constructor.
    // The items will be initialized to 0 so there is no need to memset().

    vector<tItem>	vInventory(3);			// Create an inventory list

    // Now if we print out the size of our list it would say 3
    cout << "\nThe current size of the vInventory is: " << vInventory.size() << "\n\n";

    // Go through all of the items in our inventory and initialize them
    for(i = 0; i < vInventory.size(); i++)
    {
        // We want to set our item name and weight.  Notice how it works
        // exactly like an array of tItems.  We just specify the index
        // we want to change and then access the members of that structure.

        // Set the item name to bread
        vInventory[i].strName = "Bread";

        // Set the weight to the current index
        vInventory[i].weight = i + 1;
    }

    // Go through the whole inventory and print out the information
    for(i = 0; i < vInventory.size(); i++)
    {
        // Here we print out the name of the current item
        cout << "vInventory[" << i << "]'s name is: " << vInventory[i].strName << endl;

        // Here we print out the weight of the current item
        cout << "vInventory[" << i << "]'s weight is: " << vInventory[i].weight << "\n\n";
    }

    // Here is one last example of using vectors.  If we have a normal array
    // of a data type, we can copy that entire array into a vector easily.
    // No, not through a for loop, but through the vector's constructor.

    // Create an array of 5 floats.  We put the 'f' after each one to
    // cast it as a float, otherwise the compiler will warn us about it.
    float myFloats[5] = {1.1f, 2.1f, 3.1f, 4.1f, 5.1f};

    // When you copy an array into a new vector you just pass in the
    // array name for the first parameter, then pass in a pointer to
    // the last item in the array.  To do that you just say "myFloats + 5".
    // That is how it knows the size of the vector to create.

    // Copy the array into the new vector
    vector<float> vFloats(myFloats, myFloats + 5);

    // To prove this worked, we go through the whole list and print the values
    for(i = 0; i < vFloats.size(); i++)
    {
        // Here we print out the value of each item in the list
        cout << "vFloats[" << i << "] is: " << vFloats[i] << endl;
    }

    return 0;								// Return success
}


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows us how to use the STL vector class.  If you don't know what
// STL is, it's the Standard Template Library.  A long time ago people got together
// and created a bunch of useful classes that help us do things that we are always
// doing.  This way there will be a standard and easier to port code.  Also, who wants
// to write or copy the same code over for every project?  With the invention of templates
// in C++, this also allows us to use ONE list for every data type.  No need to make
// a set of list functions for each type.  It's the most wonderful thing since sliced bread.
//
// There is another function that you might find of use.  It's the resize() function.
// You can say:
//
//					vInventory.resize(20);
//
// This will resize your inventory to hold 20 objects.  That way you don't need to
// push_back() 20 times.
//
// I use vectors constantly and I hope you see how important they are in programming
// with ease.  Once again, take a look at "stack", "queue" and "list" for more container
// classes.  It depends on what you want to do.  I usually just stick with vectors.
//
// * Remember STL containers free themselves, you don't have to free anything!  However,
//	 if you store something in the vector that has dynamic memory, you are responsible for
//	 freeing it. *

// Enjoy!
