// This tutorial shows you how to use "if statements" and "else statements"
// to control what happens in your program.  In this example, we have the user
// input their age, and then depending on how old they are, we print out a
// specialized message.  You will use if and else statements in pretty much
// every program you will ever create, especially if you allow the user to
// do things and interact with your program.  Look below to see how we use them.


#include <iostream>							// This line of code is necessary to include all the C++ standard functions\classes definitions
using namespace std;						// Set our namespace to standard (don't stress on this right now)

int main()									// This creates our function main()
{
    // This starts the main function
    int age=0;								// Initialize a integer variable for the age

    cout << "How old are you? ";			// Print to the screen a questions about the users age.

    cin >> age;								// Read in the answer after the user hits return.

    // NOW!  Get ready for IF and ELSE statements! Muhahaha!
    if(age > 20)							// This is an IF statement.  This is simply saying:
    {
        // "If age is greater than 20", then...
        // Print this message
        cout << "You're over 20 huh?" << endl;
    }										// End the if statement


    if(age > 30)							// This checks if the age entered was over 30,
        cout << "You're over 30!?" << endl;	// Print this message

    // Now you might have noticed that there was no "{" "}" brackets.
    // Well, you don't HAVE to use brackets if there is only one line
    // after the condition, either it be a while, a for, or an if/else....
    // The fact is that it's a good habit to get into and makes your
    // code more readable (which is good!)  You also tend to find yourself
    // adding things inside your statements (for, while, if), so you might as
    // well just put it there for the future, just a coding preference I guess.

    // If the user typed 35 as their age, the program would print out both messages above.
    // But if they entered something like 25, it would only print the first one.

    if(age < 20)  							// Here is another coding style...  people who put their "{" after the conditional statement.
    {
        cout << "You're a young'n!" << endl;// This doesn't do anything different, it's just that some people prefer it.
    }										// There are some languages that REQUIRE it, but C/C++ is VERY flexible where there are
    // very few REQUIRED syntax.  Actually, you could even do this and it would work:
    // "if(age < 20) cout << "You're a young'n!" << endl;"
    // You don't even need a new line OR brackets (if it's only one line after).
    // This is why ";" semicolons are important.  It let's the compiler know to
    // go on to the next statement.  you can do things like this:
    // "age++; age--; age = age;"
    // This adds 1 to age, subtracts one to age, then assigns age to age...
    // which does absolutely nothing, but you see my point.
    // You don't need to skip a line, just use semicolons.
    // it all boils down to readable code.  That is what is important.

    if(age < 20 && age > 12)				// Here is something new.  The "&&" means "and".
    {
        // So the statement is saying, "if ( age is less than 20 AND greater than 12)"
        cout << "Being in your teens can be tough..." << endl;
    }										// cout the message
    // You will use this type of expression a lot.  There is also :
    // "!=" -> does not equal    and    "||" -> or
    // So instead of checking if both things are true, you can check if one or the other are true
    // by using "||"   the OR operator.
    // If you are familiar with the binary operators, "&", and "|" ....
    // These are similar, but different.  "&&" and "||" check conditions between 2 statements.
    // if the user is a teenager, the message would have printed to the screen.

    if(age == 100)							// This checks if "age equals 100".  This is different from "age = 100"
        cout << "WOW!  What's your secret!?" << endl;
    // "age == 100" checks to see if the value of age is 100, while "age = 100" assigns the value 100 to the variable age.

    if(age > 50)							// Here is another usage of IF statements.
        cout << "Life after 50 can be great!" << endl;
    else									// If age isn't greater than 50, print the other message below
        cout << "You've still got a LONG way to go..." << endl;
    // Look below for an if/else statement explanation

    return 0;								// Return with zero problems
}											// This ends the main function (program is done)

// This is what we call IF/ELSE statements.
// "	if( <The statement here is true> )	  "
// "		<do this>						  "
// "	else								  "
// "		<do this instead>                 "

// You might be wondering by now about the spacing after conditional statements.
// It all falls back to code readability.  It's not fun to look at un-formatted code.
// If you ever want people to help you (which you WILL!) you have to comment and
// indent your code, or else they won't even try.
// Remember, you CAN and probably should use { } 's.

//		if (etc)
//		{
//			<do this>
//		}
//		else
//		{
//			<do this>
//		}

// It's so much easier to understand.  Even if you only have one line after each statement.
