// In this tutorial we will show how to do "loop".  A loop is something that
// "loops" and does something until we tell it to stop.  In this case we do
// a "for loop".  A for loop has us specify a start, and end, and an inbetween
// statement.  So, if we want to print out the numbers 1 through 100 to the
// screen, do we really want to write a line of code for each number?  Of
// course not, so we use a loop saying we want to start at 1, stop at 100,
// and increase our number by 1.  Check out below how we do this.


#include <iostream>				// This line of code is necessary to include all the C++ standard functions\classes definitions
using namespace std;			// Set our namespace to standard (don't stress on this right now)

int main()						// This creates our function main()
{
    // Beginning of the program
    int min=0, max=0, i=0;		// We initialize 3 integer (number) variables to store
    // our range.  We set them equal to zero or else they
    // will be some crazy number like -858993460.  We could
    // also have said:
    //					int min=0;
    //					int max=0;
    //					int i=0;
    // They are the same thing, it is just cleaner the other way

    // Now we prompt the user to input a number for the min
    cout << "Input your first number to count from: ";
    // Then we wait until they press <enter> and read what they typed in
    cin >> min;					// We store the number they type in in the variable "min"
    // Now we prompt the user to input a number for the max
    cout << "Input your last number to count to: ";
    // Then read in the maximum number to count to and store it in the variable "max"
    cin >> max;					// Now we have the maximum number they want to count to store

    // Now here comes the loop:
    // This is called a "For Loop".  You will use these a million times.
    // Keep in mind that there are essentially three lines of code between "for(" and ")".
    // Each line is separated by the semicolon.  This is normal for "for loops".
    // Ok, here is what it does.  It gets a starting point
    //                "i=min"     "i" is used as a counter
    // "i" now equals min, let's say we typed in 10.
    // This is the same thing as saying "i=10", but we don't
    // Know WHAT the number is so we hold it in a variable: min
    //				  "i <= max"	This says, keep looping until this condition is false.
    // In this case, "Keep looping until i is greater than max."
    // Let's pretend that max is 15.  The loop will quit when i = 16 or over.
    // You might be thinking, why would i = 16 or over?  "i" equals "min" (let's say 10)
    // Well, the next parameter passed into the "for loop" is where we say what happens to "i".
    //				   "i++"		This tells the compiler to add 1 to "i" each time through.
    // This is the same thing as saying : "i = i + 1", It's just shorthand.  The loop in words:
    // for(start; condition for the loop; after we go through the loop each time - do this)
    // You'll also notice we don't have a ";" after the "for" loop...
    // Good "i"! :)  if we put a semicolon after this, the loop would never run.
    // That is because a ";" says we are done with the line, but we ARENT...
    for(i=min; i <= max; i++)	// We never put a ";" after anything with a "{" after it .. look at "int main()" ..
    {
        // We have a "{" to say everything after "{" is in the loop
        cout << i << endl;		// Here we print out "i" each time through the loop and go to the next line
    }							// Everything after "}" is out of the loop, if the loop is not finished, go back to the top of the loop

    // You might be wondering what this does?  If so.. let's go through the loop:
    // Let's stick to our previous example of min=10 and max=15
    //		for(i=10, 10 <= 16, 10 + 1 (only if middle condition is not met, so i is still = 10) )
    //		{
    //			cout << i << endl;		// i is 10 right now (the first iteration of the loop)
    //		}
    // That is one time through the loop.  When it hits "}" .. the loop executes the 3rd statement,
    // which happens to be "i++".  Now, i = 11 right? we just added 1 to i which was 10.
    // The compiler never goes back to the first parameter which was "i=min". That was just to start "i" off.
    // So, after the first loop, and we add 1 to "i", the compiler goes and checks the middle statement
    // to see if the loop should continue.. So:
    //				"11 <= 16"  ... It's still TRUE, so we go through the loop again.
    // Now we print out 11, then "12 <= 16" , then print 12, etc...
    // until we print out "16".  After the loop ends, 16 gets 1 added to it: now i = 17.
    //				"17 <= 16"  ... This is FALSE, so the loop quits and the code
    // goes past the loop and past the "}".  Since there is nothing else in the program, the program is over.

    return 0;					// Return zero for "zero problems in this program"
}								// We end "main()" ending our program

// We just completed our first for loop.  Pretending we typed in 10 and 15, here is the output:

// Input your first number to count from: <we type in 10 and press ENTER>
// Input your last number to count to:	  <we type in 15 and press ENTER>
// 10
// 11
// 12
// 13
// 14
// 15
// Press any key to continue				// Windows way of saying "Get out of my program!" :)

// One cool thing about C++ that's different from C is that you can create
// A variable on the fly, like this:  for(int i = min; etc.....)
// In C you have to declare all variables at the top of the function.
