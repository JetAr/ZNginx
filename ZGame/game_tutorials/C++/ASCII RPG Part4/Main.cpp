//////////// *** NEW *** ////////// *** NEW *** ///////////// *** NEW *** ////////////////////

// In this tutorial we added a ton of new features for our game.  Particularly, we added
// support for fighting monsters, action keys, cut scenes, and ending (You can now win
// AND lose the game!), and finally, we added the ability to add a new player to your
// party.  There is a lot of code to go over in this tutorial, but sit back and hopefully
// that funny/silly sound that plays when you pick up items will keep you giggling long
// enough to finish this tutorial :)
//
// There is a lot of new additions, so let's first start with the cut scenes that deal
// with the actual game.  If you go into the first town of Tafar and enter the castle,
// immediately a cut scene will start and the king will call Adol to the throne.  You will
// then be given a quest.  In order to win the game you will need to find the treasure.
// The treasure is an item, but we create that item on the fly when the player enters
// the palace.  The palace is where Valkar is.  Valkar is the last boss :)  You have to
// find him.  Once you enter the palace where Valkar is, another cut scene will happen.
// This has new music and a cool sound effect :)  Another part of the story is that you
// can add another player to add to your party.  This is an npc called Jax.  You can find
// him in one of the shops in a town.  He will talk to you about how he wants to join you.
// Once he joins you, you can have a new player that follows you.  They also add to your
// attacking power when running into monsters.  Keep in mind, that in our tutorial series
// we don't allow you to do anything with an extra party member like see their stats or
// their items.  They just stick with you until they get killed :)
//
// *So, how do I attack a monster?*
//
// In order to attack a monster, you need to run into them.  If they run into you first
// then they will attack you.  But, you need to be careful.  Monsters are smart.  If
// you are in their radius they will come and attack you.  Don't get too close to them
// or you will most likely get attacked.
//
// *So what are these action keys?*
//
// We use "action keys" to add special cases to our game.  Since we want to allow
// cut scenes and special things to happen which make our game, we need ways to
// tell the code that we want to do something special.  For instance, if we want
// Jax to be added to our party, we give him an action key in our map editor when
// we placed Jax to the map as an npc.  We then check the action keys of each npc
// and see if we have a special case that needs to be handles.  This also works
// for shop keepers.  We will use the action key 555 to signal our code that this
// npc is a special npc which sells goods.  We can then program a shop for that npc
// when the player talks to them.  This will be in the next tutorial.  Not just action
// keys will signify this, but we also do checks every time we open a new map.  We do
// a special check that sees if we need to do a cut scene (like the King cut scene).
// After the cut scene is over, we set an index of our action key array that says
// that scene is already over, so don't do it again.  This is a simple way to keep track
// of what has happened in the game.  It makes it easy to save the game because we just
// need to save the action key array and we saved the game state.  Cool huh?  Of course
// we still need to save the player's data and inventory, etc.
//
// Since there is much to cover, you will better understand how these new features work
// by just jumping into the code.  We will explain further as we come across these features.
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Toggle the main menu (Or escapes a menu)
// Alt+Enter - Go full screen mode (standard console key code for any console application)
// Left Mouse Button - This chooses the options from the main menu
//					   - If you click twice on an item in the inventory menu it will
//					     bring up a prompt to use, drop or cancel.
// Space Bar - This toggles on and off the stats screen in the bottom left of the map
// To Attack - Run into a monster with the arrow keys
//
//

// This is our global action keys array.  This stores all the game situations and
// special cases.  We use this for cut scenes and story progression, along with shops (later).

// *Quick Notes*
//
// In this file we added the global action keys array, as well as put
// in place some functions that deal with our party.  We also needed to
// check for monsters every time the player moved (CheckForMonster()).
//
// In the next tutorial we will deal with buy and selling from shop keepers.
// From here let's jump to Map.cpp and see the new additions in the map.
