// This is where all the cut scenes and action key handling will be done.
// Only 2 of these functions are action key functions, HandleKey() and HandleMaps().
// The rest of these functions are just for the game's story, etc...  You will
// delete most of them when you make your own game/project.  The method of doing a
// cut scene is simple.  We just make a separate function that writes a bunch
// of dialog to the screen, with pauses between each one.  We then can use functions
// to move the players or monsters/npcs which will make it look like an animated cut
// scene.  We do this with the King animation in the castle.  Nothing is hard, tricky
// or complicated about these functions below.
//
// This is how the action keys work.  We have an array, m_actionKeys, that stores
// about 1000 slots for action keys.  We then set a certain index into that array
// as a key.  For instance, the kKingSceneKey is 1.  When this key is set to something
// other than 0, it means that we have already done the King cut scene.  That way
// when we walk into the castle we don't always have the king stop us and then give
// us a quest.  That is how we do the progression of the story.  However, we don't always
// need to set the key, like in the case of a shop keeper.  The shop keepers key is
// 555.  That means when ever we talk to an npc, we will first check if it has a action key.
// If it does, we then have an if statement that handles this key.  We don't set this
// index into our action key array because we always want to be able to buy from the shops.
// So the key is just to tell us what type of npc it is.  It has nothing to do with
// the action key since we never set or check that index.  We just check the number
// of the npc's attached action key.  We will get into shops in the next tutorial.
