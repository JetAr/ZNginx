// As you will see, we stuck everything that was at the top of main.cpp
// into a header file called main.h.  It is always good to keep our prototypes
// and #defines in header files.  That way other source files can access them
// if needed.   This also makes our code more clear and easier to maneuver around.
// Check below to see the new classes and #defines that were added in this tutorial.

// This is a #define for our game file.  The level data will be read from a text file called World.txt.
#define GAME_FILE "World.txt"

// These defines are to make our return values from GetInput() more clear.
#define STILL_PLAYING	1
#define QUIT			0

// This define is used to restrict the maximum amount of things to look at in a room.
// I chose 3 as an arbitrary number.  You can increase this to what ever you want.
// This means that we will only be able to look at 3 different things in a room.
// If we have more than 3 keywords in the game file, it will read in only 3 and ignore the rest.
#define MAX_LOOKS		3


/////// * /////////// * /////////// * NEW * /////// * /////////// * /////////// *

// These defines are exactly like the STILL_PLAYING and QUIT defines, except
// we will be using them for the outcome of fighting the monsters.  New #defines
// were created to be more descriptive than "true" and "false".  After a battle
// is over, one of these constants will be returned from AttackPlayer().
#define PLAYER_STILL_ALIVE	1
#define PLAYER_IS_DEAD		0


// This is our player class.  An instance of this class is created in Main.cpp,
// which holds the player's information.  We created a bunch of data access
// functions to set and query the players data.  The functions should be very straight
// forward to what they do.  Though there isn't must in the player class now, you will
// add more functions for the player's inventory, party members, etc...
