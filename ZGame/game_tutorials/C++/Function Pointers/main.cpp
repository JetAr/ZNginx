/*  Okay, this "lesson" is all about function pointers.  This assumes you know what a
	pointer is and "generally" how they work.

	So what is a function pointer?  Well, like the name suggests, a function pointer is
	a pointer to a function.  So we're going to write a function "PrintName" that is going
	to take a function pointer.  This will give us the capability of having "PrintName" be
	able to print out a name any way we want.

	Additionally, we're going to write two functions:
	HorzPrint() -- This prints out a name horizontally
	VertPrint() -- This prints out a name vertically.

	Okay sounds pretty easy right?  Well if you're a little confused, do not fret, all
	will be revealed :)
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// This function takes the char* passed in and prints it our horizontally (i.e. like
// you would normally read text).
void HorzPrint(char*);

void VertPrint(char*); // This function takes the char* passed in and prints it out
// vertically.  So if I passed in "game" it would print like this:
// g
// a
// m
// e

// Now, here's where all the magic is happening.
// Well, the first parameter (the char*) will be the name to be printed.
// Now what the heck is this mess:  void (*print)(char*) ???
// This is where we're saying this function takes a function pointer.
// The "void" is the return type of the function pointer (notice HorzPrint() and VertPrint()
// both return void).
// (*print) is the "name" of the function pointer.  What's important here is the '*' before
// the "print".  The '*' says this is a function pointer, we could name the function
// "spitOutToScreen" if we wanted (i.e. replace "print" with "spitOutToScreen").
// Last but not least, the "char*" is what our "function" takes as parameter(s)
// This works very much the same way as it would for a "normal" function declaration
// Again, note that HorzPrint() and VertPrint() take a char* AND only a char* as their input
// parameters.
void PrintName(char*, void (*print)(char*));

int main()
{
    char name[] = "TheTutor"; // This is the name -- Cool name if you ask me :)

    // First lets print it out vertically
    PrintName(name,VertPrint);

    // Now we'll print it out horizontally
    PrintName(name,HorzPrint);

    return 0; // Okay, I feel good about this program ending

}

// This function takes "name" and prints it horizontally (i.e. simply "cout's" it to the screen)
void HorzPrint(char *name)
{
    // Error check -- Make sure we received a valid pointer
    if(!name)
        return;

    cout << name; // Simply print out the name

}

// This function takes "name" and prints it vertically to the screen
// (i.e. prints out each letter with a carriage return after it).
void VertPrint(char *name)
{
    // Error check -- Make sure we received a valid pointer
    if(!name)
        return;

    int index = 0; // This will be the index of the letter in "name" to print out

    // While we HAVE NOT reached the end of "name"
    while(name[index] != NULL)
    {
        cout << name[index++]; // Print out the "current letter" of the name
        // and increment the index AFTER the letter has been printed out.
        cout << endl;          // Print out a blank line (carriage return)
    }

}

// This function takes a name to print "name" and a function pointer which points to a
// function that implements how "name" should be printed to the screen.  Wordy enough? :)
void PrintName(char *name, void (*print)(char*))
{
    print(name); // Print the name (it will be print in whatever style the function pointer
    // implements).

    cout << endl; // Then we're going to print a "carriage return"
}

/*

  Okay lets review:

  I hope it is obvious that a function pointer syntax is VERY SIMILAR to a "normal functions
  declaration".  Lets break down the function one more time:

  void PrintName(char*, void (*print)(char*));
	|
	|__ The return type for the function PrintName() (i.e. no return type)


  void PrintName(char*, void (*print)(char*));
			|
			|__ The name of a function (just like any other function you declare, you pick this)


  void PrintName(char*, void (*print)(char*));
				  |
				  |__ First "input parameter" to the function, it takes a char* (char array)


  void PrintName(char*, void (*print)(char*));
								|
								|__ This whole mess "void (*print)(char*)" is defining
									the second input parameter to PrintName(), which happens
									to be a function pointer.


  /////////////////// Now we'll break down the function pointer

  void (*print)(char*)
    |
	|__ The return type of the function pointer (i.e. no return type)


  void (*print)(char*)
		  |
		  |__ The name of the function pointer.  The '*' is what is important here.  The '*'
			  tells the compiler that "this is a function pointer".  The name "print"
			  is just like any other "function", we pick it.

  void (*print)(char*)
				  |
				  |__ This is the first (and only) parameter passed to the function pointer.
					  It happens to be a char* (char array).


  Well I hope that clears up the tricky syntax programmers like to call "function pointers".
