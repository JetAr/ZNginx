/*
	All righty!  This tutorial is about the very, very interesting C++ syntax known as
	"Pointers to Class Members" (in shorthand form "pointers to members").  So what exactly
	is a pointer to a class member?  Well, first we better define what a "class member" is.
	A class member is any variable or function that belongs to the scope of a class.
	Check out this example:

	class CPlayer
	{								// **This starts the scope for class CPlayer**
		public:

			void setPos(float xPos, float yPos, float zPos); // This is a member function

			float x; // This is a member variable
			float y; // This is a member variable
			float z; // This is a member variable

	};								// **This ends the scope for class CPlayer**

	So... A pointer to a class member is a pointer to either a class's member variable(s)
	OR a pointer to a class's member function(s).  Sounds confusing?!?  Well, wait till
	you see the syntax %)

	What we are going to do is create a VERY basic player class, then using it we'll show
	examples of creating a pointer to a member variable and a pointer to a member function.

	So without further ado...

#include "player.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// This function will print a player's stats (the player's position and health) to the screen
void PrintStats(CPlayer &player);

int main()
{
    CPlayer player; // Here's our player class

    // We'll set some "defaults" for our player.  First we'll place 'em at (50,50,50) in the
    // imaginary world and set his health to 100% (aka 1.0).
    player.setPos(50.0f,50.0f,50.0f);
    player.setHealth(1.0f);

    // Let's print the player's stats
    PrintStats(player);
    cout << endl; // Skip a line

    // Okay, let the CRAZY syntax begin.  First we'll JUST declare a
    // pointer to a member variable.

    // to initialize it to the player's health.

    // health member variable.

    // Well the fun is half over.  Now that you've seen crazy enough syntax to last ya a
    // year, we'll add some more equally strange syntax to the mix %)

    CPlayer johnny; // Here's our new player johnny

    johnny.*healthPtr = .25f; // Well set his health using our "pointer to a member variable"

    // Now we'll declare a "pointer to a member function"

    void (CPlayer::*setPosition)(float, float, float); // Declaring a pointer to a class's

	Member Appointment...

	Now that you've added some wicked looking syntax to your bag of tricks, you are
	probably wondering, "When in the heck am I going to use this?".  Well the answer is,
	"Could be never."  You certainly do NOT have to use "pointers to members" to make
	a ballz-2-the-wallz game.  This is an ADVANCED C++ feature that should only be
	used in cases where prudent.

	So for a prudent example... Lets suppose we have a base class CObject that
	comprises all "3D objects" in our 3D world.  It has a render() function
	which draws a wire-frame rendition of the object.  Now we also have a CPlayer
	class which we've derived from our CObject class.  The CPlayer class also has
	a render function which draws the player fully textured map and all that good stuff.
	Since both classes have a render function, CPlayer's render() will "function
	hide" (make it so we can't directly call) CObject's render(), but we still want
	to call CObject's render()!!!!  Pointers to member functions to the	rescue!  If we
	make a pointer to CObject's render() for the CPlayer, we can call both anywhere as
	we see fit.

	If you have any further quandaries about the wackiness know as "pointers to members", post
	a message at www.gametutorials.com.
