	All right, what this tutorial is going to focus on is "pointers to pointers", also
	called "double pointers".  Double pointers are really not too difficult of a concept,
	but the code can look intimidating.

	A pointer, remember, is nothing more than "a variable which represents a specific address
	in memory".  So a double pointer would be "a variable which represents a specific address
	in memory that represents another address in memory".

	Of course this chain of "pointers" can continue.  You could have "a pointer to a
	pointer to a pointer" if you wanted, but for the most part "double pointers" is as
	complex as it gets :)

	To demonstrate a use of pointers to pointers, we're going to make a 2-Dimensional array
	at runtime.  This program will prompt you for the dimensions, create the 2D array, fill
	it with numbers, and print it to the screen

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // We're creating a 2D array that is going to represent a Matrix
    // so first thing to do is ask how many rows and how many columns are going to
    // be in the matrix.
    int row = 0; // Number of rows
    int col = 0; // Number of columns

    // Get the number of rows
    cout << "Enter the number of rows (at least one, less than 10) for the matrix: ";
    cin >> row;

    // Bounds check the number of rows to make sure we don't go below or above our max/min
    if((row <= 0) || (row >= 10))
    {
        cout << "You don't follow instructions to well" << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Get the number of columns
    cout << "Enter the number of columns (at least one, less than 10) for the matrix: ";
    cin >> col;

    // Bounds check the number of columns
    if((col <= 0) || (col >= 10))
    {
        cout << "You don't follow instructions to well" << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Begin creation of the "matrix".
    // Here we're declaring a double pointer and allocating memory
    // for "row" number of "integer (int) pointers".  So when we're done, in memory we
    // will have a chunk of memory that points to chunks of memory capable of holding ints.
    int **matrix = new int*[row];

    // Let say we entered 3 for row, in memory it will look something like this:
    /*
    	[0] int*	We now have an array of three int* (pointers to int)
    	[1] int*
    	[2] int*
    */

    // Now for all the "chunks of memory capable of holding ints" -- We're going to
    // allocate space for an array on ints "col" large.
    for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
        matrix[i] = new int[col];

    // Again, we'll assume that we entered 3 for column, in memory it will look
    // something like this:
    /*
    	[0]->[0][1][2]	Each int* in our array from above, now points to
    	[1]->[0][1][2]	an array of three integers.
    	[2]->[0][1][2]
    */

    // So what we have is a "row by col" array of ints.

    // Now we're going to walk this matrix (accessing it just as if we would of
    // created in like this: int matrix[row][col];) and fill it with numbers from
    // 0 to (col - 1).
    for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < col; j++)
            matrix[i][j] = j;

    // Now print out the contents of the matrix to the screen (so it looks
    // something like a matrix).
    for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
    {
        cout << endl;

        for(int j = 0; j < col; j++)
            cout << matrix[i][j];
    }

    // Extra line for good looks :)
    cout << endl;


    // Now we must free the matrix.  First we'll free all the "col" number of
    // "integer arrays" we allocated.  Notice the syntax for freeing
    // multidimensional arrays.  matrix[] holds an array inside each index.
    // Remember that we delete arrays by putting [] after the delete keyword.
    // We need to do that for each index of the matrix multidimensional array.
    for(int i = 0; i < row; i++)
        delete[] matrix[i];

    // Then we'll free the "array of int*" we allocated
    delete[] matrix;

    return EXIT_SUCCESS; // It was a good little program
}

// What's the point of all this???

/*
	If you want to be a good C++ programmer, you have to fully grasp pointers.  It's as simple
	as that.  Pointers tend to be the most difficult C++ concept for people to grasp, so don't
	get frustrated if you haven't quite got it yet.  Like anything, practice makes perfect.
