	Sending and Receiving - Server Side

****************************************************/

// Things that will be covered in this tutorial:
// sending and receiving messages of fixed length between a client and server
// - send()
// - recv()

// By this point we should be able to startup winsock, create a socket,
// bind to a port, begin listening, and accept a connection from a client.
// Now the only thing left to do (and the purpose behind networking in
// the first place) is to actually SEND data!

// Winsock for our network communication
#include <winsock2.h>
// Stdio for I/O
#include <stdio.h>

// Since we have covered a lot of material so far, I am going to wrap up
// just about everything we have done in a couple functions.
// Note: This is JUST for convenience in this tutorial.  In practice, there are
// MUCH better ways of encapsulating network setup.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// startupServerForListening() - will return us a socket that is bound to the
// port we specify, and is listening for connections if all operations succeeded,
// and a -1 if startup failed.
int startupServerForListening(unsigned short port);

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// shutdownServer() - will take the socket we specify and shutdown the
// network utilities we started with startupServerForListening()
// Note: In order to function properly, the socket passed in MUST be the
// socket created by the startupServerForListening() function
void shutdownServer(int socket);

int main()
{
    printf("Welcome to redKlyde's Networking Tutorials!\n");
    printf("Tutorial # 3 : Sending and Receiving - ServerSide\n\n");

    // The socket my server will use for listening
    int serverSocket;

    // Startup our server utilities with my handy function
    serverSocket = startupServerForListening(7654);

    // Check for errors
    if (serverSocket == -1)
    {
        printf("Network Startup Failed!\nProgram Terminating\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Accept a client
    int clientSocket;
    clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, 0, 0);

    // Check for errors
    if (clientSocket == SOCKET_ERROR)
    {
        printf("Accept Failed!\n");
    }

    // FINALLY ... we are actually getting to something worthwhile.  We have created our
    // server socket, setup that socket for listening and accepting connections, and we have
    // accepted a client which we can communicate with via the clientSocket.  We are now ready
    // to send and receive data.

    // For sending and receiving we need a few variables to keep track of things.

    // First, we need to keep track of the number of bytes we have sent and received.  This will help
    // us keep determine when communication runs smoothly.
    int nBytes;

    // Next, we need some buffers.  We have to have a buffer from which we send data, and
    // a place to store the data we receive.

    // I will define a message size so we will know how much data we will send and receive
#define MESSAGE_SIZE 24

    // And the actual buffers
    char inMessage[MESSAGE_SIZE];
    char outMessage[MESSAGE_SIZE] = "I received your message";

    // When my client connects, they will send me a message first thing.  So go ahead and receive
    // a message from my client using the recv() function.  recv() takes 4 parameters.  The first
    // parameter is the socket that we are receiving data from.  The second is the location to
    // store the data we received.  The third is the maximum number of bytes to receive in this recv().
    // And the fourth parameter is a flag which we can change how recv() is handled (for all our
    // networking needs, this flag will always be 0).  recv() will return the number of bytes actually
    // received from the recv() function.  Just like our previous networking functions, recv() will return
    // SOCKET_ERROR if some error has occurred ... so we better check that after we recv().

    // Receive at MAX sizeof(inMessage) bytes into inMessage from the client using clientSocket
    nBytes = recv(clientSocket, inMessage, sizeof(inMessage), 0);

    // check for errors
    if (nBytes == SOCKET_ERROR)
    {
        printf("Recv Failed!\n");
    }

    // At this point we should have received data from clientSocket, and stored it in inMessage.
    // So lets print out our input buffer and see what the message was ...
    printf("Message Received : %s\n", inMessage);

    // Since we received data from our client, our client application will await a response from us.
    // So lets send him a message back.  We will do this with send(), which works pretty much
    // the same as recv().  With 4 parameters, the first is the socket, the second is the location
    // of the message we are SENDING, and the third is the size of the message we are sending.
    // Just like recv() our flags parameter will be 0.

    // Send sizeof(outMessage) bytes from the buffer "outMessage" to the client on clientSocket.
    nBytes = send(clientSocket, outMessage, sizeof(outMessage), 0);

    // Check for errors
    if (nBytes == SOCKET_ERROR)
    {
        printf("Send Failed!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        // If there were no errors, print our message
        printf("Message Sent : %s\n", outMessage);
    }

    // And congratulations ... we have just sent and received data between 2 programs!

    // The exact purpose of the third parameter of send() and recv() may be a bit unclear.
    // We defined it as the "size" of the message we are sending, and the "size" of the
    // message to receive, but we also mentioned that it was just the MAXIMUM number of bytes we
    // could receive.  If this is a MAX, is it possible to receive LESS data than we expected?
    // In short this answer is yes, but we will get to the details in part 2 of this tutorial.

    // Now that we have sent data back and forth from our client ... we have to clean house.
    // This involves closing any sockets we opened, and shutting down our network.

    // Close our client socket
    closesocket(clientSocket);

    // Shutdown our network
    shutdownServer(serverSocket);

    printf("Press any key to continue ...\n");
    getchar();

    return 0;
