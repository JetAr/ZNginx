//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load and play MP3 and WAV files.  This is was
// an exciting tutorial to write because it does so much for you!  The Fmod library
// is perfect for games and demos.
//
// * What Can I Play With This? * (WAV, MP3)
//
// Though this tutorial only plays .mp3's, it will play a .wav with the same code,
// there is no need to change anything except the actual file name.  Cool huh?
//
// I would like to thank the team at www.Fmod.org for the library and also the sample
// source code.  The code in this tutorial was primarily from the sample distributed
// in the FMod library.
//
// I would also like to thank NIB at freemp3snib.homestead.com for the music!
