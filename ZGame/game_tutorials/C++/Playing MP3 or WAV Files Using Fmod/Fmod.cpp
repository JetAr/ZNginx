// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load and play MP3 and WAV files.  This is was
// an exciting tutorial to write because it does so much for you!  The Fmod library
// is perfect for games and demos.
//
// * What Can I Play With This? * (WAV, MP3)
//
// Though this tutorial only plays .mp3's, it will play a .wav with the same code,
// there is no need to change anything except the actual file name.  Cool huh?
//
// * Files Included *
//
// The files included are necessary for compiling and running the application.
// You do not need the FMODVC.LIB or FMOD.H to run it of course, but to compile
// it you will.  You will ABSOLUTELY need FMOD.DLL to run the application.
// For those of you who haven't worked with DLL's before, a DLL is a Dynamic
// Linked Library that access functions on the fly, in run time.  VB uses them
// for their applications.  It is different than a static link library (.lib)
// because the .LIB's code is compiled into the .EXE.  DLL's are great if you
// have multiple applications uses the same code and don't want to bloat your
// files.  You can either stick the DLL in your system directory or in the same
// directory as the application being run.  Once again, the DLL is a MUST have
// to run your application.  I might add also, that the fmod.h isn't the standard
// fmod.h that you get with the downloadable zip from www.fmod.org.  I added
// the fmod_errors.h file to the end of it because it was a small amount of code
// to leave in a header file.  It's better to just have 1 header file in this case.
//
// I love this library and I hope you will too!!  Let us know what you do with it.
//
// I would like to thank the team at www.Fmod.org for the library and also the sample
// source code.  The code in this tutorial was primarily from the sample distributed
// in the FMod library.
//
// I would also like to thank NIB at freemp3snib.homestead.com for the music!
