    /*
    	Default Constructor

    	When you create a class prototype you get four methods by default.  They are
    	a constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.  This tutorial
    	only talks about the first one, the constructor, but just realize that by default you get
    	all of these methods.  Now of course, you can write your own versions of these methods,
    	overriding the default, or you can just use the default.  Depending on what the class
    	is meant to do will determine if you write your own or use the default methods.

    	The default constructor does not take any arguments.  It is used to give the member
    	variables of your class a default value.  If you choose not to overwrite it, your member
    	variables will be assigned random values.

    	There is no return value from a constructor.  So if an object fails when you are
    	constructing it, you can not return a flag to say there has been an error.
    */
    CStrObj(); // We are overwriting the default constructor and providing our own implementation

    /*
    	Overloaded constructor

    	As mentioned above, the default constructor takes no parameters.  However, you can
    	overload the constructor, and provided as many variations as you like, provided they
    	follow the rules of C++ function overloading.

    	Here we are creating a constructor that takes a const char* as an argument and sets
    	the CStrObj to the argument passed in.
    */
    CStrObj(const char *str);

    void set(const char *str); // Sets CStrObj to "str"
    void print(); // Prints CStrObj

    /*
    	Below we use the access specifier "private".  Remember that an access specifier stipulates
    	the allowable access to a group of methods and variables inside of class.

    	When you think of the keyword "private" you think of "remaining private" or "unaccessible to
    	anyone besides yourself".  Any function or variable that is private can not be accessed by an
    	instance of the class.  Lets give a quick example:

    		class CClass
    		{
    			public:
    				int mInt;

    			private:
    				float mFloat;
    		};

    		int main()
    		{
    			CClass c;

    			c.mInt = 50; // Since "mInt" is public, this is allowed

    			c.mFloat = 25.0f; // Since "mFloat" is private this is not allowed
    							  // This would give a compiler error

    			return 0;

    			**NOTE** The same holds true for methods.
    		}

    	The private keyword really makes encapsulation, one of the three necessary components of an
    	object-oriented programming language, possible.  In general, the reason to create a class, is
    	so that you can provide a set of well defined methods.  You do not want	a user of the class
    	to directly manipulate the member variables, so you make them private.  This way, they can only
    	interact with the member variables by calling your predefined functions.

    	So to recap... When you create a class prototype, any method or member variable that is
    	private can only be accessed within the scope of the class.

private: // All methods and member variables following will be "private"

    char mStr[kMaxStrLen]; // The character array holding the literal string
};
