// This is probably the simplest of the tutorial series.  All we added was the
// code necessary to handle buying and selling from shop keepers.  We will now
// be able to buy items and equipment, as well as sell that equipment.  This is
// done by giving each shop keeper a simple action key of 555.  When ever we
// talk to a shop keeper, we will check their action key and then jump right
// into the buying and selling menu.
//
// *What will the shops sell?*
//
// Since our item's data is usually stored in the Items.txt file with the
// map editor, we need to access that data when we create our shops.  This is
// why we use the same items text file used to make the maps for this game.
// We just stick that text file in our project directory.  Then, when ever
// the player goes to the store, it will read some random items from that
// text file to sell.  Of course, you might want the items to be static and
// not change, which will require you to make some changes to make this happen.
// But, for the purpose of a simple way to get items in our shops, we use this
// method.  We read some random items from the text file each time the user
// talks to the shop keeper.  Ideally, you will want to add support in the
// map editor to choose which items that shop keeper will hold.  Also, you
// probably don't want the items file to be easily accessible to the user,
// since they can just easily open it up and change the data to really
// ridiculous high stats right?  This is all something you can add yourself
// in your own project.
//
// To create the shop menu, we inherit from the CMenu class, since most of
// the functionality is the same.  This allows for good code re-use.  We
// added 2 new files for the shop code, ShopKeeper.cpp and ShopKeeper.h.
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Toggle the main menu (Or escapes a menu)
// Alt+Enter - Go full screen mode (standard console key code for any console application)
// Left Mouse Button - This chooses the options from the main menu
//					   - If you click twice on an item in the inventory menu it will
//					     bring up a prompt to use, drop or cancel.
// Space Bar - This toggles on and off the stats screen in the bottom left of the map
// To Attack - Run into a monster with the arrow keys
//
// We have a shop keeper placed in each town, behind a counter in one of the
// houses.  Think of that as the local tavern or something :)  There is nothing
// really new in this file except the declaration of the global CShop object, so
// you can immediately jump over to ShopKeeper.cpp to go over the rest of the tutorial.
//
