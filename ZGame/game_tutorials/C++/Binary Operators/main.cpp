	This tutorial focuses on "binary operators" -- the binary operators we are going to
	talk about are  AND (denoted by a '&' in code)
					OR  (denoted by a '|' in code)
					XOR "exclusive or" (denoted by a '^' in code)

	Okay, now if you don't know what binary numbers are, you are up a creek!  Just kidding
	of course.  So first a quick lesson on binary numbers.  Binary numbers are the 1's and
	0's that the computer uses to run.  It's the lowest form of a computer language.

	Now first we need to give the "TRUE" mathematical definition of base10 numbers (these are
	the ones you use all the time -- 1, 2, 3...)  Oh, and first a little notation:  I'm going to
	treat the '^' to mean "raise to the power of" -- So 2^2 = 4 (two squared) - Got it? :)

	The base10 system works like this;  If we have the number say 21 for example what we are
	really saying is this:

	10^4	10^3	10^2	10^1	10^0

     0		 0		 0		 2		 1

	This says we have (2 * 10^1) + (1 * 10^0) units -- A little algebra:
	(2 * 10) + (1 * 1) = 21

	Does this make sense??? -- Look at it closely and it should.  Squint if you have too :)
	Now binary numbers work the same way.  Except instead of being base10, they are base2

	So now we'll represent the number 21 in binary

	2^5		2^4		2^3		2^2		2^1		2^0

	 0		 1		 0		 1		 0		 1

	This says we have (0 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
	Algebra goes here:  0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21

	Pretty simple huh???

	Okay now that your a binary numbers expert lets move on...

	Lets use the numbers 5 and 6 as examples.  First, we
	represent 5 and 6 as binary numbers:

	101 = 5
	110 = 6

	The AND operation works like this:	0 AND 0 equals 0
										0 AND 1 equals 0
										1 AND 0 equals 0
										1 AND 1 equals 1

	So just like you add two numbers, you go column by column from right to
	left (you can also go left to right)

	101
	110	 AND
	---
	100 = 4				So 5 & 6 = 4 -- Excellent, you are now our a master of the AND operator

	************************************************************************************************

	The OR operator -- Again will use 5 and 6 as our numbers.

	The OR operation works like this:   0 OR 0 equals 0
										0 OR 1 equals 1
										1 OR 0 equals 1
										1 OR 1 equals 1

	Thus:

	101
	110  OR
	---
	111 = 7		So 5 | 6 = 7 -- You have now become a MASTER at the OR operator

	************************************************************************************************

	Last, but not least the XOR (exclusive or) operator -- Again our numbers will be 5 and 6

	The XOR operation works like this:	0 XOR 0 equals 0
										0 XOR 1 equals 1
										1 XOR 0 equals 1
										1 XOR 1 equals 0

	Thus:

	101
	110  XOR
	---
	011 = 3		So 5 ^ 6 = 3 -- A master of XOR you now are young Jedi

	/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

	I've put a handy dandy "Truth table" at the bottom of this .cpp

	Now on with a few more examples and a couple practical uses :)
*/

// Set this to one to see the answers for the binary operations below
#define SHOW_ANSWERS 1

#include <iostream> // We can use cout
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1 = 8;
    int num2 = 3;

    int answer = 6; // We'll store our answers in here

    // Okay, for your sake I would suggest FIGURING OUT ON PAPER what should be printed out
    // once you do it, you won't forget :)

    // Print out the result of num1 AND num2
    answer = num1 & num2;

    if(SHOW_ANSWERS)
        cout << num1 << " & " << num2 << " = " << answer << endl << endl;

    // Print out the result of num1 OR num2
    answer = num1 | num2;

    if(SHOW_ANSWERS)
        cout << num1 << " | " << num2 << " = " << answer << endl << endl;

    // Print out the result of num1 XOR num2
    answer = num1 ^ num2;

    if(SHOW_ANSWERS)
        cout << num1 << " ^ " << num2 << " = " << answer << endl << endl;

    // Print out the result of (num1 AND num2) XOR (num1 OR num2)
    answer = (num1 & num2) ^ (num1 | num2);

    if(SHOW_ANSWERS)
        cout << "(" << num1 << " & " << num2 << ") ^ (" << num1 << " | " << num2
             << ") = " << answer << endl;

    return 0; // End of program

} // end of main()

// Practical uses -----

/* Well for starters, the fastest way to set a variable to zero is to XOR with itself
   So if I have int an_int = 7;

	And I want to set it to zero I could go:

		an_int = an_int ^ an_int; --- The short-hand version -- an_int ^= an_int;

	An ALL MIGHTY compiler would switch ever "an_int = 0;" into "an_int ^= an_int"
	VC++ is pretty good about this

	Another example is say if you want to know if a number is odd --
	Well this piece of code will do it for ya:

	if(a_number & 1)
		// The number is odd
	else
		// The number is even

*/

/* LET THE TRUTH BE KNOWN:

	Here's the truth table --

		AND	 OR	 XOR
	00|  0    0   0
	-------------------
	01|  0    1   1
	-------------------
	10|  0    1   1
	-------------------
	11|  1    1   0
	-------------------
