//***********************************************************************//

#include <iostream>							// This line of code is necessary to include all the C++ standard functions\classes definitions
using namespace std;						// Set our namespace to standard

// What we do in this tutorial is create a menu for the user to select options from.
// You know how on a calculator there are things like square root, cosine, sine, etc...?
// Those are called functions.  Those functions allow us to do things with just calling
// one function and not having to actually do the math for the square root, cosine, etc.
// Functions in programming are the same.  We create a function that does something, and
// then we can call that function by just 1 line of code, not actually copying and pasting
// the code each time we want to perform that function.  This makes code smaller, more readable
// and less frustrating :).  In this tutorial we create a menu function that draws the menu options.
// Some functions take parameters and some return values.  For instance, square root takes a number
// to square, then it returns the result of the square root right? : (double value = sqrt(49);)
// The "value" is the return value, and the 49 is the parameter that is passed into the function.
// This is an example of using a function, however, in this tutorial we won't use a input parameter.
// When programming large projects, we have many different .cpp files.  When we create a function
// we want other .cpp files to be able to use that function that might perhaps be in another
// .cpp file.  To do this, we create "function prototypes".  These are just one line declarations
// of the functions.  We then put these "function prototypes" in .h files (header files).  In
// this way other .cpp files can all include the .h (header) file and the compiler can recognize
// the function by it's prototype.  It's really to help out the compiler... since we are nice guys/gals :)
// We will go into greater detail later. Below is our function prototype for our DrawMenu function.


void DrawMenu();							// This declares our function name and what it returns.
// This declaration would usually			// This let's the compiler know we have a function, and what parameters we need to pass in.
// Go in another file, say, functions.h		// This is like declaring a variable.  We initialize our variable at the beginning,
// Then usually assign it something later
// In our case, our function doesn't need to return anything so we put a "void" , meaning nothing.
// if you look down at "main()" you'll notice that we use "void" too.  We aren't returning anything in main usually.
// The next tutorial will deal more with functions and returning things from them.
// When declaring a function, we must put a semicolon after it.

void DrawMenu()								// This is the part where we assign the function to do something.
{
    // We don't use a semicolon because we are not finished with the function, we are starting it with "{" and ending it with "}"
    cout << "\t\t ****************Game Menu**************** \n";
    cout << "\t\t *                                       * \n";	// This is our game menu, comprised of cout's :)
    cout << "\t\t *   1) New Game                         * \n";	// Beautiful isn't it?  hehe.
    cout << "\t\t *   2) Load Game                        * \n";	// You can obviously find more creative ways to display a menu than this.
    cout << "\t\t *   3) Save Game                        * \n";	// Just, somehow we have to let the user know their options
    cout << "\t\t *   4) Inventory                        * \n";	// You'll notice the "\t".  this is like "\n", but it means TAB.  It's just so you
    cout << "\t\t *   5) Options                          * \n";	// Don't have to press space bar 5 times... I am just expanding your C++ vocabulary :)
    cout << "\t\t *   6) Quit                             * \n";
    cout << "\t\t *                                       * \n";
    cout << "\t\t ***************************************** \n";
}																	// This is the end of the function.

int main()
{
    bool bStillPlaying=true;				// Here we declare a type of "bool" which stands for boolean.
    int choice=0;							// A boolean is usually a flag that holds a value, true, or false. (true is anything but 0, false is 0)
    // In this case, let's make a boolean and set it to true, meaning we
    // are "bStillPlaying" the game.  When Quit is chosen, we will set it to false, ending the game loop.
    // Once again, we put the 'b' in front of "StillPlaying" to show that it's a boolean.  This provides good readable code.

    // Let's create a while loop to continue until they Press '6' for quit.
    while(bStillPlaying)					// This says, do everything below until bStillPlaying == FALSE.  Remember, a statement doesn't happen if 0 is the result from the expression.
    {
        DrawMenu();							// All we need to do is call our function, like so.  This will draw the menu.
        // Since there are no parameters to pass in, we just close the parenthesis (); with a semicolon.
        // Now comes the part where we need to be able to choose from the menu.

        cout << "Choose from the menu: ";	// Prompt the user

        cin >> choice;						// Get the user's choice

        // Below we create a switch statement.  I chose to use this instead of if/else statements.
        // For a quick review on switch statements, this is just a cleaner way to check values of a variable.
        switch(choice)						// i.e. "case 1:"  is the same thing as saying, "if(choice == 1)"  You see?  A lot cleaner
        {
        case 1:
            cout << "You chose a New Game!\n";		// if (choice == 1)
            break;					// break - breaks out of the switch statement.
        case 2:
            cout << "You chose to Load a Game!\n";	// if (choice == 2)
            break;									// Print the choice and break;
        case 3:
            cout << "You chose to Save a Game!\n";	// if (choice == 3)
            break;									// Print the choice and break;
        case 4:
            cout << "You chose your Inventory!\n";	// if (choice == 4)
            break;									// Print the choice and break;
        case 5:
            cout << "You chose Options!\n";			// if (choice == 5)
            break;									// Print the choice and break;
        case 6:
            bStillPlaying = false;					// if (choice == 6)
            cout << "Game over already?\n";			// bStillPlaying is set to false.  This means, when the code goes back up to the top, while(bStillPlaying) will NOT be true and fail.
            break;									// A weird thing about switch statements, you don't need brackets {} for more than one line.
        }													// You just need a break;
    }	// while (bStillPlaying)							// It's a good idea to label what the closing bracket is coming from.
    // When your code gets huge, it's kind of annoying to go back and match up all the brackets to find the statement.

    return 0;												// Once the user hits 6, the while loop quits and will end our program,
}															// We return 0 to say "zero problems occurred"


// And that's it!  Here is a menu.  Sure it's the simplest menu ever, but it's a start :)
// The more important thing here is the use of a function.
