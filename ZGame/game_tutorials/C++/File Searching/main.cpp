/*	Okay this tutorial is all about searching for a file (specifically a text file)
	The user will have to specify the directory they want to search in AND the name
	of the text file (must end with .txt) -- If we find the .txt file specified
	we'll print it out the screen, otherwise the program crashes horribly,
	(just kidding) it prints out "File specified does not exist."

	So without further ado...

// **CAUTION**
// cin >> dirPath and cin >> fileName will stop reading in characters as soon as
// they find a white space (" ").  So if you have directories or file names with
// spaces in them, this tutorial won't work as you expect.
