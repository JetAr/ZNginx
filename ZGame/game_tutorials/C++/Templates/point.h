#ifndef POINT_H
#define POINT_H

// Here is our templated class.  As you can see it's REALLY SIMPLE (the operator+ is the
// only thing that looks a little menacing :)
// Lets go over this syntax once again.

// Okay, you see the keyword "template".  This says we're doing a templated class (or function).
// Directly after "template" you see <typename type>.  This says, "The name of our generic
// data type (that can become ANY data type) is "type".  So when you want variables to
// be of this generic data type we will declare them as type "type".
template <typename type>
class CPoint
{
public:

    CPoint(); // Default constructor

    // Copy constructor
    // Notice how we define the variables being passed in
    // as type "type".  This really is no different than if
    // we were defining them as type "int" for example.
    CPoint(type xVal, type yVal, type zVal);

    // Same thing here, everywhere we want a "generic, can be anything variable"
    // we use the keyword "type" (which is what we defined at the top of the class).
    void set(type xVal, type yVal, type zVal);

    // Now here's slightly different syntax.  You'll notice that for
    // the RETURN variable we HAVE to put the class name and our
    // templated variable name in angled brackets, but for the input parameter(s)
    // to the function, we ONLY use CPoint (just like normal).
    // **NOTE** For those who are not completely fluent with the overloading of operators,
    //			all this does is allow us to write code like this:
    //			ccc = aaa + bbb;
    //			where aaa, bbb, and ccc are all of type CPoint<type>.
    CPoint<type> operator +(const CPoint&);

    // This is our data
    type x;
    type y;
    type z;
};


// And now the implementation part...

// First we'll do the good old default constructor.
// For EVERY method you implement you will HAVE to start with the
// EXACT same syntax you declared your class with.
template <class type> // See, it's the same as above the class declaration
CPoint<type>::CPoint()
{
    // Now if this WAS NOT a templated class, the syntax would look like this:
    //
    // CPoint::CPoint()
    //
    // So you see how you HAVE to add the <type> BEFORE the scope resolution operator?
    // **NOTE** the scope resolution operator equals :: (double colon's)

    // Let's default to zero
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
}

// Okay, now it's the overloaded constructor.
// Again we HAVE to start out with the "template syntax".
template <class type>
CPoint<type>::CPoint(type xVal, type yVal, type zVal)
{
    // As you can syntax looks similar to the default constructor

    x = xVal;
    y = yVal;
    z = zVal;
}

// Okay, next we'll implement the set function.  Guess what syntax goes first?
template <class type>
void CPoint<type>::set(type xVal, type yVal, type zVal)
{
    // Notice here that first (like usual) is the return type of the function
    // After that the "pattern" remains the same:
    // void CPoint<type>::set(type xVal, type yVal, type zVal)
    //	|	 |     |      |
    //	|	 |     |	  |__ Name of function
    //	|	 |	   |
    //	|	 |	   |__ Name of templated data type we declared
    //	|	 |
    //	|	 |__ Name of class
    //  |
    //  |__ Return type

    x = xVal;
    y = yVal;
    z = zVal;
}

// Last but not least, we'll implement the overloaded + operator
template <class type>
CPoint<type> CPoint<type>::operator +(const CPoint &point)
{

    // Notice there's slightly different syntax:
    //
    // CPoint<type> CPoint<type>::operator +(const CPoint&)
    //	|			|     |       |				  |
    //	|			|	  |		  |				  |__ Input parameter DOES NOT include
    //	|			|     |		  |					  templatized variable type
    //	|			|	  |		  |
    //	|			|	  |		  |__ Name of the function (yes "operator +" can be
    //	|			|	  |			  thought of as the name of a function)
    //	|			|	  |
    //	|			|	  |__ Name of templated data type we declared
    //	|			|
    //	|			|
    //	|			|__ Name of class
    //  |
    //	|
    //  |__ Return type.  This MUST include the templatized variable type
    //

    // Now here's the next (and last) piece of syntax knowledge.
    // When you declare a temporary variable of your templated class
    // inside of a function in your templated class (like we are doing here)
    // you DO NOT use the angled brackets/templated variable name (the <type> in our case)
    CPoint answer;

    // Calculate our answer
    answer.x = x + point.x;
    answer.y = y + point.y;
    answer.z = z + point.z;
    return answer;
