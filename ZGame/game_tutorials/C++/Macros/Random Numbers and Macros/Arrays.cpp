//***********************************************************************//


// Welcome to a very important tutorial.  We will be discussing the topic of
// "arrays".  An array is just a list of data.  When you think of the word
// "array", think of how people say "what a beautiful array of colors".  For
// instance, a rainbow has an array of colors.  Or in other words, a list or
// group of colors.  When you think of a word or a phrase, you are actually
// looking at an array of characters right?  The same goes for programming.
// In this tutorial we create a random array of numbers and print them out
// to the screen.  An array's data is stored in memory right next to each other,
// so it isn't very useful for dynamic lists.  We will show you later how
// to work with types of lists.  Go through the comments and code below to
// see how to use arrays.


#include <iostream>							// This line of code is necessary to include all the C++ standard functions\classes definitions
#include <windows.h>						// This allows us to use the function Sleep() which is a delay
#include <time.h>							// We need to include this to call the time() function.
using namespace std;						// Set our namespace to standard

#define MAX_NUMBERS 15						// This is called a define.  Usually the #defines go after the includes.
// Typically, with defines.. they are ALL_CAPS and use underscores between words.
// This lets the coder know that this is a define.  You might be asking.. why use define?
// How are they different from variables?  Well, variables allocate memory.
// The line "int i;" asks the operating system (OS) for some memory so that it could hold a number.
// Defines on the other hand, don't take any memory, but instead REPLACE where ever it's typed with it's definition.
// In this case, you notice we use MAX_NUMBERS in our for loop.  Before the compiler compiles the code, it "secretly"
// goes and replaces the MAX_NUMBERS with 15.  Does that make sense?  It's literally as if we typed it our self.
// In nearly all applications, these are used.  They are useful because ...
// What if you use MAX_NUMBERS, a 100 times in your code?  What if want to change the number later?
// All you have to do is go to the top of this file and change the 15 to what ever number you want.
// If you had just typed 15, 100 times throughout your code, you would have to change them one by one.
// Even though there is a find and replace in most applications, trust me... it doesn't always work out
// Like you think it does.  If you have 50 different files for your project.. are you going to go and
// Find and replace in ALL 50 files?  It's SOoOoOooO time consuming and tedious.  I learned the hard way :)
// Since #defines can't be seen in the debugger, it's usually better to us constant variables: const int kMaxNumbers = 15.
// You will see these used later in our tutorials.  The 'k' is for constant :)

// You can also use defines like this:
// "#define PRINT_SCORE(score) cin << "Your score is " << score << "." << endl
// If I type PRINT_SCORE(<a variable>) anywhere, it will substitute the cout statement and print the value of the variable passed in.
// Like this: PRINT_SCORE(<a integer>) cout << "Your score is " << <a integer> << "." << endl
// Do you get it?  It's like your own personalized cout!
// The bad thing with defines are.. if you have a syntax error (you didn't follow the compiler's rules),
// they are HARD to trace.  Also, don't put a semicolon after the #define statement, since it is a literal replace where you use it.
// In Fact, let's do a #define of PRINT_NUM()

#define PRINT_NUM(num) cout << num << endl	// See what I mean?  All this does is print the number passed into as "num" (num isn't the name, just the word to replace in the cout statement).
// And go to the next line.  Simple huh?  You notice there isn't an "=" sign,...
// Because #defines are just replacing text, not assigning values.  #define are also called MACROS.
// We have successfully made our first macro.
// Don't put a ; after the macro, you will do that when you call (in other words, use) the macro.


int main()									// The beginning of our program
{
    // This starts the main function
    int list[MAX_NUMBERS]= {0}, i=0;			// Initialize the array of integers (numbers) and a counter "i".
    // This line says that we now have storage for MAX_NUMBERS (which is 15) integers.
    // If we didn't have arrays, we would have to do things like:
    // int i, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, i7, i8, i9, etc... and who wants to do that?? (besides the freak who just raised his hand :) )
    // The = {0} sets all the slots\numbers in the array to 0.
    cout << "\nThe not so random list:\n\n"; // Display a word about the "not random" list.  notice the '\n' ...
    // We can insert this into a string and it does the same thing as endl;
    // We can put it anywhere in a string.  We must have the backslash in front of the n though.
    // This is a bit cleaner than << endl << endl;  As you will see, it won't print out: \n,
    // but will just go to a new line where it was in the string.  Try it.

    for(i=0; i < MAX_NUMBERS; i++)			// We call our for loop that will continue to print out MAX_NUMBERS (15) random numbers
    {
        // Start the cycle if the expression in the middle is true.
        list[i] = rand();					// list[i] means, the slot "i" (which will start out as 0) in list gets a random number.
        // Say, the random number came out to be 2200.  In the beginning, since i = 0;  list[0] would equal 2200;
        PRINT_NUM(list[i]);					// If list[i] was 2200 , then PRINT_NUM() would print out 2200 to the screen.
    }										// End of the cycle and check at the top if we need to continue.

    // The for loop will continue to go until i == 15.  Then it will stop.
    // Run this program again and you will notice that the numbers are the same every time.
    cout << "\nThe TRULY random list:\n\n";	// They are different from each other, but the same every time.
    // We need to "seed" the random number generator. To do this, we use time.
    // The computer's internal clock will always be changing, so we start the random number on our system's time.
    srand( (unsigned int)time(NULL) );		// srand() stands for "seed randomizer"  ... or something like that :)
    // We pass the function time() to srand() to seed the random generator. We pass in NULL to time() because we
    // don't care what format is returned.  However, we need to cast the return value to an unsigned int because
    // that is what srand() wants!

    Sleep(3000);							// This functions causes a delay for about 3 seconds.  1000 is ~ 1 second.  ~ means approximately. (1000 Milliseconds = 1 second)

    // Let's see that again...
    for(i=0; i < MAX_NUMBERS; i++)			// Now you'll notice the differences in numbers EVERY TIME .. or at least when the clock changes :)
    {
        list[i] = rand();					// Randomize the new list

        PRINT_NUM(list[i]);					// Print out the randomized number.
    }
    // Now we will restrict the random numbers so that we don't get numbers in the 10's of thousands.
    // Print the new title of numbers
    cout << "\nThe *restricted* TRULY random list:\n\n";

    Sleep(3000);							// Sleep for 3 seconds

    for(i=0; i < MAX_NUMBERS; i++)			// Notice the differences in numbers every time.
    {
        list[i] = rand() % 100;				// Randomize the new list with numbers less than 100.
        // using the modulus operator "%" we can restrict the random numbers to being less than 100;
        // Here is an example on how modulus works.  It's kind of like divide, except it returns the remainder of the divide instead
        // "  15 % 5 = 0,      15 % 7 = 1,    15 % 26 = 15 "
        // Can you see why?  it's the remainder.  15 / 5 = 3 with NO remainder, so 15 % 5 = 0
        // 15 / 7 has a remainder of 1.  15 % 26 returns 15 because anything being moded by a higher number, just returns that number that is being moded.

        PRINT_NUM(list[i]);					// Print out the randomized number.
    }

    return 0;								// Return zero for "zero problems in this program"
}											// The end of the program

// *FUNCTIONS EXPLANATION*
//
// Let's talk about the Sleep() function for a second.  Sleep() is a function that does a delay.
// In the case of Sleep(), you want to tell it how long to delay...  So, we pass in the
// number 3000 like so:  Sleep(3000);  Sleep takes milliseconds as the parameter.  1000 = 1 second.
// I would like to caution you on how you use your macros.  They can be very nice, but also
// can cause problems if you don't do them correctly.  Make sure you know the macro compiles
// correctly before you start adding it all over your project.  This will save time with debugging
// in case you didn't have the syntax right in the first place.
