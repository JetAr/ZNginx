//**********************************************************************************//

Files:  	Main.cpp (The source file containing the actual code)
		Database.cpp (The source file containing the database code)
		Database.h (The header file containing the database class)
		GTDatabase.mdb (The Microsoft Access database file)
		Database.vcxproj  (The VC++ project file holding the project info)
		Database.sln  (The solution file holding the solution info)

Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 just click on the
		<Program Name>.sln file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.cpp.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .cpp extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		a console window should pop up with the program. :)
