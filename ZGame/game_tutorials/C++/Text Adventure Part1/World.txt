You step into a house where you are nearly
blinded by the light shinning through the window.
You have been searching for your friend who was captured.
The trail has led you to this mansion.
There is a door in every direction.*

There is a fountain in the middle of this room.
The cool, crisp air swirls about and encircles you.
There is only one door to the east where you came.*

You step back outside of the mansion and grab some fresh air.
It is quite refreshing, comapred to the damp smell from within.
You here rustling from the second story of the house.  It could be your friend.
Your only option is to go back inside and get them out of here!*

As you pass through the door you feel a chill run
down your spine.  It appears that there something or 
someone or something sitting in the corner, covered by darkness.
There is no where to go but back to the west.*

As you get closer to the second story of the mansion, the sounds of someone
struggling can be heard more distinctly.  There is no turning back now.
One door is to the south and one is to the north up a stairwell.*

<End>
You find your friend tied to a chair.  Their hands, feet and mouth are bound,
but it's as if their eyes are screaming at you.  Short bursts of muffled yells
are heard from under the cloth that holds their mouth, as if to say, "Run!".  
What could they be trying to say?  As you walk closer to them they seem to get 
louder and more depserate. That's when you see it.  It had been lurching in the
corner, feathered by darkness.   To be continued...*
