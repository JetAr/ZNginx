// *Quick Notes*
//
// We added 3 new functions to the player class in order to load and
// save our player data to and from a save game file.  Since there is
// lists assigned to the player, we needed to save the player data
// first, then go through the data in the lists and save/load each item
// in the list.
//
// Let's finally go to SaveLoad.cpp and see the functions which control
// the saving and loading of game files.
