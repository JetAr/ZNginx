// In this file we define the basic functions for our CPlayer class.  Besides our
// standard constructor and deconstructor, we have Init(), Draw() and Move() functions
// for our player.  These are pretty simple and much of the code has been used in past
// tutorials when dealing with character movement.
//
// In the next tutorials we will add more functions that are specific to the game.
//
//

// *Quick Notes*
//
// This file defines the constructor, deconstructor, Init, Draw and Move
// functions for the start of our player class.  There is nothing new
// or interesting yet about this code when compared with previous tutorials.
// Take a look at Player.h for the class, then jump over to Map.cpp.
