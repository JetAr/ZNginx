// This tutorial is the first part of a large tutorial series that show you how to
// take our console tutorials and incorporate all of them to make a simple game.  We
// will be using the Ascii Map Editor that we created in that tutorial series to create
// the maps for our game.  This game will not be a robust game, but will include most
// of the major features you need to have in order to make a (RPG) game.  For example:
//
// Loading maps, collision detection, player movement, exiting to other maps,
// the ability to interact with characters, inventory system, sound/music, fighting
// monsters, gaining levels/experience, stats, buying and selling from shops, saving
// and loading previously saved games, added party members, simple ai, cinematic cut
// scenes, menus and dialog.
//
// Wow, looking at all of those options make you want to cry!  But don't worry, we will
// go over each one :)  You can wipe away your tears of intimidation and put on some
// sunglasses and sip on a cool lemonade because this tutorial series is gonna be *Hot*!
//
// *So what is the game?*
//
// The game is a simple RPG where the character, "Adol" is given a quest by the King.
// Apparently, the King's treasure has been taken he Enlists Adol to go find it.  Adol
// goes to different towns and gets hints as the where the treasure might be.  He is
// then able to join up with a character "Jax", who will join the party and go fight for
// the treasure too.  They then find the treasure is taken by Valkar, who used to work
// for the King, but was a monster in disguise and a murderer.  You fight Valkar and then
// take the treasure, which ends the game.  The game ending is different depending on who
// is in your party.
//
// This is a very simple game with no complex or interesting plot, but it should get
// you excited to use your own creativity to make a robust game with a robust plot and
// interesting dialog with the characters :).  The programming techniques in this tutorial
// series don't reflect the best or most efficient/fastest methods, but the simplest methods
// to help someone who wouldn't know how to do these features to be able to get a start
// to do them.  That is the intent of this series, to give you the most basic ways to
// program a game like this.  You then can take it and improve it.
//
// *What does this tutorial include?*
//
// In this tutorial we will be able to move a character around, load maps, exit to other
// maps and ride a pony.  Well, ... we won't be able to ride a pony, but it's just as fun!
// So, just the basic movement of the game, with the collision detection added as well.
// The character starts on the "Default.map", which is right outside the town "Tafar".
//
// Since we are using the maps that we created from the Ascii Map Editor it will be easy
// to get us moving around on them.  The work is already done.  I went and created the
// whole world for our game in the editor.  You can find those maps in the Maps\ directory.
// Each map is connected to another map.  The character will be able to walk around the maps
// and when they hit an exit, it will transition to another map (depending on the destination
// map set in the editor).  We have shops, houses, towns, outside wilderness, etc...
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Quit the game
// Alt+Enter - Go full screen mode (standard console key code for any console application)
//
// The base for this code was primarily taken from the Ascii Map Editor code, but has been
// changed enough to warrant everything *** NEW *** :)  If you haven't looked at that code then
// you should, since we won't be going over much explanation in this tutorials of topics
// already covered, but will focus more on the game design and theory of how to put the
// game together.
//
// Let's get on with the code!
//

// To handle our map loading and such, we have a global map object.  We also
// have our player object global as well.  To handle input we created an object
// to control the user's input.  We also store the cursor position for menus later.

CMap g_Map;										// This stores our global map object
CPlayer g_Player;								// This stores our global player object

    g_Player.Init(playerImage, kPlayerStartX, kPlayerStartY);

    // Init the map and load the first map.  Then set the flag that tells
    // the map's Draw() function to draw that frame.  We don't want to draw
    // every frame, but only when something happens.
    g_Map.SetDefault();
    g_Map.Load(kStartMap);
    g_Map.SetDrawFlag(true);

// Below we define our CInput class to handle the input from the user.
// We don't create another file for it since it's not that big yet.

    // the input for it.  It doesn't handle it as much as stores the information
    // for us to use elsewhere.  For instance, the key or mouse button that was pressed.
    // We only need to write this code once, and then we can use it in many other
    // places when we do different code for things like character movement, menu

    // We only want the game to keep going as long as the character is alive.  Of
    // course, in this tutorial the character can't die, but we set this up for later.
    // In the game loop we always check for input every frame, then we draw the map.
    // We don't draw the map every frame, but inside the Draw() function there is
    // a check to see if the draw flag is set.  That is why we use the SetDrawFlag()
    // function to tell the map to draw.  If we don't set that each frame, the map
    // will not draw, even though we call the Draw() flag.

    // Keep the game going while the player is alive
    while(g_Player.IsAlive())
    {
        // If the user did some input, let's check it and handle it
        if(g_Input.CheckInput())

        // Let's draw the map when we need to draw (if the draw flag = true).

//
// *Quick Notes*
//
// This first file was pretty simple.  Nothing too new was really added,
// but it's important to get a input and drawing setup done correctly
// so that you can specify the game loop and have the basis for your game.
//
// I suggest checking out Player.cpp next to see the player movement and
// draw code.  You can then check out the beefy parts in Map.cpp :)  This
// code is what was formerly called Tile.cpp in the Ascii Map Editor.
//
// All we did in this Main.cpp file is create an Init() function to load
// and setup our map and player.  We then created an object to check for
// input from the user (CInput).  Next, we create a function to handle that
// input for the main game loop (movement of the character...), which is
// HandleGameInput().  This isn't all of the input, but the main game
// movement.  We use other functions for menu and save\load functions.
//
// We then have out main() function which has our main game loop.  The
// loop will go until we either quit with ESC, or die, which is impossible
// in this tutorial.
//
// In the next tutorial we will focus on the dialog of Npc's and music/sfx.
// We need to also go over menu code in order to do this.
//
// Good luck till then!
