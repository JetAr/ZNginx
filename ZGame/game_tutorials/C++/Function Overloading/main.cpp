/*	Function overloading is one of the wonderful advantages C++ has over C (Can you tell I
    like C++ better?)  In C land, lets say we wanted to write a function that took the average
	of two int's -- The function prototype would probably look something like this:

	float Average(int num1, int num2);	// Returns the average of num1 and num2

	Now lets say we wanted to do the average of two doubles.  We'd have to come up with a
	whole new name:

	float AverageDouble(double num1, double nun2); // Returns the average of num1 and num2

	//////////////////// Well in C++ Land, function overloading is supported so that means that

	double Average(int num1, int num2);
	double Average(double nun1, double num2);

	equate to DIFFERENT functions.  You can have as many functions as you want named "average",
	so long as the variable types (int, double, etc) are different or there is a different
	number of variables passed in.

	So,

	double Average(int num1, int num2);				is known to be different than
	double Average(int num1, int num2, int num3);

	That's it -- It's really quite simple -- Here we'll overload the "average" function just
	to show that I'm not lying!

	*/

double Average(int num1, int num2);	// Returns the average of two integers

double Average(double num1, double num2); // Returns the average of two doubles

double Average(int num1, int num2, int num3); // Returns the average of three integers

int main()
{
    double answer = 0.0; // Variable for holding the answers from the average functions

    // Print out the average of two integers
    answer = Average(43, 24);
    cout << "The average of the integers 43 and 24 = " << answer << endl << endl;

    // Print out the average of two doubles
    answer = Average(23.2, 62.33);
    cout << "The average of the doubles 23.2 and 62.33 = " << answer << endl << endl;

    // Print out the average of three integers
    answer = Average(2, 22, 222);
    cout << "The average of the integers 2, 22, 222 = " << answer << endl << endl;

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

// Returns the average of two integers
double Average(int num1, int num2)
{
    return (num1 + num2) / 2;
}

// Returns the average of two doubles
double Average(double num1, double num2)
{
    return (num1 + num2) / 2.0;
}

// Returns the average of three integers
double Average(int num1, int num2, int num3)
{
    return (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;
}

/*	If you are feeling overloaded, relax, life is too short...

  Here is an example of function overloading that WILL NOT WORK!!!!

  double Ave(int num1, int num2);
  int Ave(int num1, int num2);

  Functions that are overloaded CAN NOT only differ by RETURN TYPE!
  Other than that rule, you can overload to your hearts content.
