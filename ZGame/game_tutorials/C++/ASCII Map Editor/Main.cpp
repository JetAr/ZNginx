// This tutorial is the first part in our ASCII based map editor series.  In this tutorial we
// go over how to setup our editor and show how to select tile characters and change their colors.
// There is no real functionality in this tutorial because I don't want to overwhelm the newbies
// with tons of code.  Thus, we made it into a tutorial series :).  Make sure you understand
// how to get input and draw to the screen in a console window.  If you don't know how to do
// this, please refer to our tutorials on these topics.  Also, make sure you understand the
// basics of inheritance with classes.
//
// This tutorial is primarily based off of the 2D Map Editor tutorial series for Win32.
// If you want to do something like this in 2D, check out that tutorial series.
// The code is probably 90% the same, so it will be an easy transition to make a 2D map editor.
//
// * What is an ASCII Map Editor? *
//
// So, what is a ASCII tile based map editor?  I am not sure if you ever played the old ASCII
// adventure games like Moria or Nethack, but these were very popular for their time.  There was
// no graphics using conventional pixels, but they created worlds using just the ASCII characters
// on the keyboard.  We have about 255 characters that we can use in our ASCII set.  ASCII stands
// for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  Originally, in 1963 when these
// characters were first used, there was just 7 bits, 0 to 127, which were the normal English
// keys, but later it turned into 8 bits, which allowed for international languages like European,
// and Scandinavian languages.  You will notice many of these characters when you run the editor.
// Anyways, using these 255 characters we can actually create beautiful worlds that actually look
// like we are using graphics.  At Digipen, Institute of Technology (A video game programming school),
// one of their first projects is to create a game using no graphics at all, but just using text.
// The thought process is that before one can program cool graphical games, they need to have a
// basic understanding of simple concepts in programming like creating maps, checking input from
// the user, saving, loading, inventory systems, lists and other important things that aren't
// tied so much to graphics.  Sometimes people will see pretty colors and want to jump into making
// the next quake engine, but they have no idea how to even create a character, load a map or use
// any sort of list system.  DON'T become one of those programmers, it's annoying to others :)
// ASCII games are a great start to test your skills before you move into advanced graphics.  If
// you can create a game using ASCII, you can very easily make the transition to graphics and not
// have to worry about the logic programming.  In no time you will be making a ASCII Final Fantasy :)
//
// As you make more games you will want to move onto more complicated and cooler style games
// which require a more complicated and cooler editor.  This tutorial series is intended to help
// you get started with a basic editor, then more on from there.  This is not intended to be a
// robust or even pretty editor, but a starting ground for someone who has never made anything
// like this before.  I encourage you to go VASTLY beyond what is taught in this series.  We will
// provide an example architecture, then you should go on from there to suit it to your game's need
// and make it pretty, like your mom :)
//
// * What does this tutorial do? *
//
// In this tutorial we just display a console window, fill it up with default tiles of grass,
// then draw a simple editor section.  We then fill that section up with tiles to choose from.
// You can choose between the different ASCII characters, and if you want to change the foreground
// or background, you can click on the colors at the bottom of the screen.  The first 16 colors are
// for the foreground (the character's color), where the next 16 colors are for the background.
// So far, all you can do in this tutorial is just click on the tiles on the bottom and change their
// colors, but you can't place anything on the map yet.  That will be in the next tutorial.
// Hitting ESCAPE will close the program.
//
// Enough talking (typing), let's jump into the code!
//
//

// This is our global lists for our tool bar.  These lists hold the tiles for the
// map tiles, the items, the monsters and the NPC's (Non Player Characters).
// These are not the lists that hold information for the current map, but we choose from
// these lists and then place the chosen tile on our map.  The map tile information is
// held in the g_Map variable, which is defined a bit farther down below.
// We will be using STL Vectors for our lists.  If you are not familiar with this
// please look at our C++ Vectors tutorial to understand their usage.  It's basically just
// an easy way to make a list of something, so you don’t have to always write your own list code.
vector<CTile> g_vTiles;							// Create a list for the map tiles to be loaded
vector<CItem> g_vItems;							// Create a list for the item tiles to be loaded
vector<CMonster> g_vMonsters;					// Create a list for the monster tiles to be loaded
vector<CNpc> g_vNpcs;							// Create a list for the Npc (citizen) tiles to be loaded

// Since we will be loading 2 maps at the same time later for exits we create a pointer
// which stores the current map we are working with.  That way it cuts down on code.
// We currently only load one map in this tutorial, but instead of change it all around
// in the next tutorials, I figured we could start out using this pointer.. "z'ok?"  :)
CMap *g_pCurrentMap = NULL;

// This is our map class which holds all the information for the current map.  When we load
// a map, all that information is stored here.  This is the most important class in our editor.
CMap g_Map;

// We will be using a bit of complicated code in this series, which allows us to choose different
// tiles that are inherited from the base class, CTile.  That way we don't need to have a
// variable for each type of tile that we are working with.  We can just cast this pointer
// to the appropriate type, like a CItem, CMonster, etc...  This pointer stores the current
// tile that the user has chosen.  We just will insert this tile into the map if the user
// clicks the right mouse button (but not till the next tutorial :)
CTile *g_pCursorTile = NULL;

// This stores the current cursor position in our console window
COORD g_cursorPos = {0};

// *Quick Notes*

// This file is pretty simple, we just set up the main structure of

// We didn't necessarily use all of the data in this tutorial, but we
// have set up the data for the next tutorials.
//
// In the next tutorial we will focus on how to draw the desired tile,
// whether it be a tile, item, monster or npc.  This will be pretty simple.
