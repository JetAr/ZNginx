///////////////////////////// ADD NEW BACKGROUND \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

CHAR_INFO CMap::AddNewBackground(CHAR_INFO image1, CHAR_INFO image2)
{
    // Okay, here is some trick that allows us to take the background
    // color of image2 and apply it to image1.  Since the foreground and
    // background color are stored in 1 number, we need to do some binary
    // math to extract out just the background color.  Let's look at the
    // defines for the background and foreground colors so that you can
    // understand why we do what we do.  These are stored in WinCon.h in
    // your compiler's include\ folder (In this case, Visual Studio .Net):
    //
    // #define FOREGROUND_BLUE      0x0001 // text color contains blue.
    // #define FOREGROUND_GREEN     0x0002 // text color contains green.
    // #define FOREGROUND_RED       0x0004 // text color contains red.
    // #define FOREGROUND_INTENSITY 0x0008 // text color is intensified.
    // #define BACKGROUND_BLUE      0x0010 // background color contains blue.
    // #define BACKGROUND_GREEN     0x0020 // background color contains green.
    // #define BACKGROUND_RED       0x0040 // background color contains red.
    // #define BACKGROUND_INTENSITY 0x0080 // background color is intensified.
    //
    // Notice that these are defined in hexadecimal, and the foreground are the
    // last slot, whereas the background is the second to last slot in hex.  This
    // way we are able to distinguish the place where the different colors are stored.
    // If you have a scientific calculator (you can use the windows calculator), input
    // 0x0008 (or just 0x8, which is the same thing in hex) and then convert that to
    // decimal.  You will get 8.  Now, convert that to binary and you will see 1000.
    // This isn't one thousand, but the binary number for 8.  That means that the
    // first 4 slots (or bits) in binary store the foreground values.  Now, take
    // the highest one for the background, which is 0x0080.  That's 128 in decimal,
    // and 10000000, which is 8 bits.  If all the bits are turned on, it's 255.  That
    // is the max size for a "char" variable.  Well, we are using a WORD, which is 16
    // bits of data.  So, we have established that the first four bits (counting from
    // right to left as you should in binary) are for the foreground, and the next 4
    // are for the background.  So, let's get to the math for extracting the background.
    //
    // We can use the binary operator << or >> which moves the bits of a number to the
    // left (<<) or right (>>) by a given amount.  If 8 in binary is 1000, then 8 >> 4
    // would make it 0100 then 0010 then 0001 and finally, 0000.  That's right!  It just
    // deleted the 1 bit that was originally there before.  That means we just destroyed
    // all the bits turned on (with 1), which changes the number.  Well, if we did
    // that to a color value, it would destroy the foreground color.  If we want to reset
    // the background color we can't just move 4 the other way, since we are working with
    // a 16 bit variable (WORD).  We actually need to move the bits 12 to the left.  This
    // will reset the bits for the background.  BUT WAIT!!  We need to move the bits back
    // to their original position, we can't just leave them there.  So, we move over 12 to
    // the left, and then move them back to the right 12.  This goes for the foreground, we
    // need to move the bits back to the left by 4.
    //
    // So, now what??!?!?  Okay, now we can do a binary OR (|) between the 2 color values,
    // which will basically create a number that stores all the 1 values in binary between
    // the 2 other numbers (colors).  So, in effect, we want to reset image 1's background
    // color values since we are giving it new ones, then we want to reset the foreground
    // color values in the desired background color value so that we don't override the
    // foreground color of image1 (since we want those to stay).  Now, when we do a binary
    // OR between the 2, they will mix and create the new desired background and the old
    // desired foreground.  Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.  If you don't
    // understand how binary math works, you should really understand this if you want to
    // be a programmer.  You can check out our tutorials on binary math to brush up.

    // Here we move the bits to the left by 12 bits and back 12 to reset the background color
    image1.Attributes = image1.Attributes << 12;
    image1.Attributes = image1.Attributes >> 12;

    // Here we reset the foreground color by moving the bits to the right 4 and back to the left 4
    image2.Attributes = image2.Attributes >> 4;
    image2.Attributes = image2.Attributes << 4;

    // Now the magic of binary OR's.  We or the 2 color values together to get a mix
    // of the desired new background in image2, and the desired old foreground color in image1.

    // Let's now return the new image with its cool new background!  (Isn't math fun! :)
