// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load most types of MOD or MIDI files.  This is was
// an exciting tutorial to write because it does so much for you!  The Fmod library
// is perfect for games and demos.
//
// * What Can I Play With This? * (MIDI, MOD)
//
// You can play most, if not all MOD formats like .mod, .s3m, .xm, etc....  The file
// extension isn't important because the FMod library checks the actual file type.
// You can call it what ever you want.  This also plays MIDI files.  You don't need
// any new code, just change the file name to a MIDI and it will work!  Cool huh?!!?
//
// Once again, using mods for demos is cool because you can check the position in the
// song, then trigger a cool effect depending where it is.  For instance, you could
// say, if the order is 8 and the row is 36, Scale the screen, or start moving in.
// There is so much that can be done with the FMod Sound System.
//
// * Files Included *
//
// You will ABSOLUTELY need FMOD.DLL to run the application.
// For those of you who haven't worked with DLL's before, a DLL is a Dynamic
// Linked Library that access functions on the fly, in run time.  VB uses them
// for their applications.  It is different than a static link library (.lib)
// because the .LIB's code is compiled into the .EXE.  DLL's are great if you
// have multiple applications uses the same code and don't want to bloat your
// files.  You can either stick the DLL in your system directory or in the same
// directory as the application being run.  Once again, the DLL is a MUST have
// to run your application.  I might add also, that the fmod.h isn't the standard
// fmod.h that you get with the downloadable zip from www.fmod.org.  I added
// the fmod_errors.h file to the end of it because it was a small amount of code
// to leave in a header file.  It's better to just have 1 header file in this case.
//
// I love this library and I hope you will too!!
//
// I would like to thank the team at www.Fmod.org for the library and also the sample
// source code.  The code in this tutorial was primarily from the sample distributed
// in the FMod library.  I created the class from the underlying code.  I hope you
// find much use for it.
//
// I hope this helps you make wonderful applications!  All the credit goes to
// "FireLight Multimedia" because they made they library, I just made a neat client.
