<Middle>
You step into a house where you are nearly
blinded by the light shinning through the [window].
You have been searching for your friend who was captured.
The trail has led you to this mansion.
There is a door in every direction.*
<north> Top
<east>  Right
<south> Bottom
<west>  Left
<look>  1 window

<Middle|window>
The light pierces your eyes, causing you to wince in pain each time you look directly at the window.*

<Left>
There is a [fountain] in the middle of this room.
The cool, crisp air swirls about and encircles you.
There is only one door to the east where you came.*
<north> None
<east>  Middle
<south> None
<west>  None
<look>  1 fountain

<Left|fountain>
A beautiful fountain stands erected in the middle of the room.  It kinda makes you thirsty.*

<Bottom>
You step back outside of the mansion and grab some fresh air.
It is quite refreshing, comapred to the damp smell from within.
You here rustling from the second story of the house.  It could be your friend.
Your only option is to go back inside and get them out of here!*

<Right>
As you pass through the door you feel a chill run
down your spine.  It appears that there something or 
someone or [something] sitting in the corner, covered by darkness.
There is no where to go but back to the west.*
<north> None
<east>  None
<south> None
<west>  Middle
<look>  1 something

<Right|something>
You squint your eyes towards the corner where the mysterious entity resides...  Nothing moves.*

<Top>
As you get closer to the second story of the mansion, the sounds of someone
struggling can be heard more distintcly.  There is no turning back now.
One door is to the south and one is to the north up a [stairwell].*
<north> End
<east>  None
<south> Middle
<west>  None
<look>  1 stairwell

<Top|stairwell>
This is the only place where your friend could be.  You'd best go up it, carefully.*

<End>
You find your [friend] tied to a [chair].  Their hands, feet and mouth are bound,
but it's as if their eyes are screaming at you.  Short bursts of muffled yells
are heard from under the cloth that holds their mouth, as if to say, "Run!".  
What could they be trying to say?  As you walk closer to them they seem to get 
louder and more depserate. That's when you see it.  It had been lurching in the
corner, feathered by darkness.   To be continued...*
<north> None
<east>  None
<south> None
<west>  None
<look>  2 friend chair

<End|friend>
Your friend seems to be pleading with you in the chair to run.  You have never seen them that scared before.*

<End|chair>
The wooden chair holds your friend tightly, with ropes seemingly strangling the body that is tied to it.*
