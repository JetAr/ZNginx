// * INTRO *
//
// This tutorial is the second of the 3 part series.  In this tutorial we will be able to
// put things to look at in our rooms.  We are adding a new command called "view" that
// will allow us to type in an object or keyword to look at.  After we type "view", then
// hit return, it will prompt us to type in the key word that we want to look at.  This
// can only be one word because we are using "cin" to read in the data.  You can use
// getline() for multiple words, but be prepared to sort out the bugs of using getline()
// and "cin" at the same time.
//
// We add a new block to our room description: "<look>"
// This will store the number of keywords in the room, and their names.  Then
// we create a header similar to the room header to store the keywords description.
// More of this will be explained throughout the tutorial and at the end.
//
// Here is a list of all the commands:	look view north south east west help quit.
// Below is an explanation of what each command does:
//
// "look"  - This will display the room's description
// "north" - This will move the player north if there is a valid room
// "south" - This will move the player south if there is a valid room
// "east"  - This will move the player east if there is a valid room
// "west"  - This will move the player west if there is a valid room
// "help"  - This will display the list of available commands
// "quit"  - This will quit the game
//
// To fully understand this tutorial, you will need to be comfortable with arrays.
// We use an array to hold the keywords stored in each room (if any).  Check out our
// tutorials on arrays if you need some refreshing.
//
//

// This is a #define for our game file.  The level data will be read from a text file called World.txt.
#define GAME_FILE "World.txt"

// These defines are to make our return values from GetInput() more clear.
#define STILL_PLAYING	1
#define QUIT			0

/////// * /////////// * /////////// * NEW * /////// * /////////// * /////////// *

// This define is used to restrict the maximum amount of things to look at in a room.
// I chose 3 as an arbitrary number.  You can increase this to what ever you want.
// This means that we will only be able to look at 3 different things in a room.
// If we have more than 3 keywords in the game file, it will read in only 3 and ignore the rest.
#define MAX_LOOKS		3

/////// * /////////// * /////////// * NEW * /////// * /////////// * /////////// *

// This is our room structure.  This holds all the information about the current room.
// Notice that we added 2 new variables to our tRoom structure.  These will hold the
// information about keywords that we will be able to "view".
struct tRoom
{
    string strCurrentRoom;				// This stores the name of the current room we are in (I.E. "Hallway")
    string strRoomDescription;			// This holds the description of the current room
    string strRoomNorth;				// This holds the name of the room that is to the north
    string strRoomEast;					// This holds the name of the room that is to the north
    string strRoomSouth;				// This holds the name of the room that is to the north
    string strRoomWest;					// This holds the name of the room that is to the north

/////// * /////////// * /////////// * NEW * /////// * /////////// * /////////// *

    // Here we create an array with the size of MAX_LOOKS (3).  That means we can hold
    // 3 keywords max for each room.  For example, "floor", "creature" and "darkness".
    // We then need a variable to store the description of that keyword, like we do for
    // the room description.  Once we choose a keyword to look at, we first make sure
    // it's in the strLookArray, then search the game file for it's description.

    // Here is an example run through:  Say we read in the keywords for a room in a log cabin.
    // There are 2 keywords: "fork" and "chair"
    // Let's say I choose to look at "bed".  It will then go through the whole strLookArray,

    // Say we are in the room titled, "Stairway", and we want to look at the object, "knife".

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This concludes our second tutorial of the 3 part series.  Now we can look
// at objects/things in our rooms.  To look at something, type in "view" and hit return.
// You will then get a prompt to enter the keyword to look at.  Then you
// type in the keyword and hit return.  If the keyword is valid, then it should
// display the description to the screen.  I placed brackets '[' ']' around each
// of the keywords to make the obvious.  You may or may not want to have these,
// depending on if you want it to be harder for the user to get hints or clues on things.
//
// Let's go over the new syntax added to the game file.  Our room block now looks like
// this:
//
// <Middle>
// You step into a house where you are nearly
// blinded by the light shinning through the [window].
// You have been searching for your friend who was captured.
// The trail has led you to this mansion.
// There is a door in every direction.*
// <north> Top
// <east>  Right
// <south> Bottom
// <west>  Left
// <look>  1 window
//
// Everything else is the same except for the "<look>" data.  This stores the
// number of keywords in the current room, and their names.  In the above example,
// we have "1" keyword, and it's name is "window".  That means that we can look
// at a "window".  What happens when we look at a window?  Well, the game then searches
// the game file for this block:
//
// <Middle|window>
// The light pierces your eyes, causing you to wince in pain each time you look directly at the window.*
//
// The look header has the room's name and the keyword, with some brackets and a
// separator between the room name and keyword.  This is just the syntax I chose, you
// can change it to what ever makes it more clear for you when creating levels.
// The reason why we associate the room name with the keyword is because we want to
// be able to have keywords with the same name in different rooms.  If we had 2 rooms
// that had a window to look at in it, it would just find the first window in the game
// file and never get to the second room's window description (IE <window).  This way,
// if the room "Middle" has a window, and the room "Top" has a window, we can distinguish
// between: "<Middle|window>" and "<Top|window>"
//
// The next line after the look header is the actual description we want.  Like the
// room description, it has a '*' at the end of it to show that we are done.  This way
// we can have multiline descriptions.
//
// It might be a good idea to convert all the data to lowercase when reading it in,
// just in case you don't capitalize one letter like this case: "<middle|window>".
// When editing text files this happens all the time.  Leave the descriptions the
// same of course.
//
// Hopefully the comments around the new functions above are enought to explain what's
// going on.  If not, pop us an email for a larger explanation.  We aim to please :)
// The next tutorial will allow us to actually put some enemies in our world and fight them.
// I hope that you are starting to get idea's on how you can put other things in your world,
// such as items for an inventory, other players to talk too, trap doors, etc...
//
// Till next time!
