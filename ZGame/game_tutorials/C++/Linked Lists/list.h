/*
	First off, what is a linked list?  A linked list is a list of "nodes".  Nodes can
	thought of "structures" that hold data and a link to another node.  These nodes are
	"chained together" to form a list.

	A link list IS NOT a LIFO or FIFO structure by default.  So it is very important to
	define a couple of key terms in a linked list.

	The "head" of the list points to the "beginning" of the list.  For our list
	implementation this is ALWAYS going to be the FIRST node placed in the list UNLESS
	we place a node before the head in which place this node becomes the new head node.

		**NOTE** It is not uncommon to have the "head" node be the last node placed
				into the list

	The "tail" of the list points to the "end" of the list.  For our implementation this
	will be the node who's next link is NULL.  Check out the diagram below.

		**NOTE** You can define your list how you want, just be specific :)

	A graphical representation of our linked list may look something like this:

		[data]->[data]->[data]->[data]->[data]->[data]->NULL
		"head"									"tail"

	NULL (or an empty node) is the most common way to signify the end of a linked list

	The "head" and "tail" will be kept track of internally.  Our list is going to give the
	client (person using it) four ways to enter data:

	1) Before the head
	2) After the head
	3) Before the tail
	4) After the tail

	To retrieve data stored in the list the client can either:

	1) Retrieve the data stored at the head node
	2) Retrieve the data stored at the tail node

	I think that about does it.  So on with the list making...

// This is a VERY COMMON data structure used by linked lists.
