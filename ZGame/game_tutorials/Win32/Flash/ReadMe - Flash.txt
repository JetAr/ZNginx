Files:  	Main.cpp (The Source File containing the main program code)
		CFlash.cpp (The Source File containing our CFlash class definitions)
		CFlash.h (The Header File containing the Flash class definitions)
		Flas.vcxproj  (The VC++ Project File holding the project info)
		Flash.sln  (The Solution File holding the solution info)


Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 just click on the
		<Program Name>.sln file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.cpp.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .cpp extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it
 will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		the Win32 program should pop up. :)
