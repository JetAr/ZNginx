// This tutorial shows you how to load Macromedia Flash media into a Win32
// application.  You must have a Flash player installed to do this.  You
// can download a free player from Macromedia's website.
//
// * What is Macromedia Flash? *
//
// Flash is a program that allows you to create amazing multimedia and
// animation using vector graphics, among other standard formats.  Flash
// presentations can create dynamic content as well.  It has its own special
// language called "ActionScript".  Flash applications can be really small
// in size when doing animation because Flash can save vector data instead
// of per-frame pixel data.  Calculations are made each frame to animation
// the objects.  You can embed most standard video and graphic files into
// flash as well.
//
// * GameTutorials.com and Flash *
//
// If you have noticed, the GameTutorials.com site uses Flash for the main
// navigation.  Notice how much content is packed into the animations and such,
// yet the file size is only around 300K.
//
// So, what we do in this tutorial is load a .SWF file and embed the Flash
// into our Win32 application.  A .swf file is the final compiled file that
// Flash makes from the initial .FLA file, which is the workable project.
//
// Let's jump into the code.  It's pretty straight forward.
//


// Instead of doing a global object, let's make our CFlash object a pointer.
CFlash *g_pFlashObject = NULL;

// Let's create a rectangle that defines our desired window position.
RECT g_WindowRect = {0, 0, 800, 600};

// This functions handles all the messages for windows
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc (HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);

// This will be our file that we want to load
const char g_szFile[] = "Main.swf";

// Our Win32 Main() function

                    PSTR szCmdLine, int iCmdShow)
{
    HWND        hWnd;										// HWND - a HWND is a handle to a window.  This is used to keep track of a certain window.  Programs can have multiple windows.  We only have one though.
    MSG         msg;										// MSG  - A MeSsaGe variable to hold what messages are being sent to the window (If the window was clicked, closed, moved, etc...).
    WNDCLASSEX  wndclass;									// WNDCLASSEX - This variable will hold all the information about the window (The name, icon, cursor, color, menu bar...)

    wndclass.hCursor       = LoadCursor (NULL, IDC_ARROW);	// We call a function called LoadCursor that returns information about what cursor we want, I chose an arrow.  The NULL is in place of a hInstance.  We don't need one in this case.
    // Here we set the background color.  GetStockObject() returns a void so we must "cast" (turn it into) it as a HBRUSH to be compatible with the variable "hbrBackground".  I chose GRAY
    wndclass.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH) GetStockObject (WHITE_BRUSH);
    wndclass.lpszMenuName  = NULL;							// We don't have a menu, so let's set this to NULL.
    wndclass.lpszClassName = "GameTutorials";				// Here we set a name for our class, to distinguish it against others.  We need to use this name for later when we create the window.

        DispatchMessage (&msg);								// "The DispatchMessage() function dispatches a message to a window procedure."  - This means it handles the message, like it the message was to close the window, it closes the window.
