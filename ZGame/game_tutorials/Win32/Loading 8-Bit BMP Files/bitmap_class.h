/*
	Okay here's our class for holding the information read in from the 8-bit .bmp file
	As you are well aware, when we load an image (any image) we need a place to store
	it, so as WE know how it is laid out.  I'm going to use a DIBSection to store the
	8-bit .bmp

	There are basically two types of bitmaps.  Device Dependent Bitmaps (dependent on the
	video card) and Device Independent Bitmaps (does not depend on video card, but slower
	to work	with).  However, a DIBSection gives you the benefits of both (doesn't depend
	on video card, fast, access to pixel bits)

	I'd say if your working in Win32, use a DIBSection to store all of your images once
	you have loaded them is a safe, effective way to go.

	Now the only function that is going to be HEAVILY COMMENTED (tutorialized to the max)
	is the loadBMP() method in our class.  This is what this tutorial focuses on.  If you
	want, you can easily cut-n-paste this code in a different program and load an 8-bit
	bitmap into an text file or whatever :)

	On with the show......
