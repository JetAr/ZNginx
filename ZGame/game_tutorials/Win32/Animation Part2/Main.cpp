////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// *WARNING!!!*
//
// The function, TransparentBlit() is a dangerous one.  You might be better
// off writting your own, or doing a mask blit (explained in another tutorial).
// TransparentBlit() supposadly only works on win2k and windows 98.  BUT, on
// windows98 it leaks massive amounts of memory.  This is not the best function
// to use.  You can replace it with DisplayPortionOfBitmap(), but then it won't
// be transparent....  It's a cool function, but too bad it leaks memory. :(
// After a while, the monster will disappear and eventually will probably crash
// if you are running windows 98.  it will just keep sucking up GDI resource in memory.
//
// *Quick Notes*
//
// Now we have a creature that walks around the screen animating from one file.
// If you right click your mouse, he changes direction (or states...)
// You can have multiple sprites too!! This is a lot of code to digest in one
// sitting.  Just take parts of it and try to get it to work.  I designed this
// myself, so there is a ton of other ways to make some sort of sprite routine.
// C++ is really nice, because you don't have to call a free functions for every
// sprite or buffer, etc... it takes care of it in the deConstructor.
//
// I made the window so you couldn't resize it by passing in the WS_SYSMENU flag
// at the top when I create the window.  Since the bitmap is only as big as the
// initial window, it would look strange if you resized it.  I created a unused
// function called DrawBackgroundImage() that stretches the background image
// to the client rectangle of the screen, but if we are erasing the sprite with
// a part of the screen, it doesn't work because the screen is stretched.  You
// can use that for something else if you want.
//
// *Steps For Using A Sprite*
//
// 1) Define the sprite like so:  SPRITE gMonster;
//
// 2) Load the sprite: LoadSprite(the sprite structure,
//								  the bitmap to use, the width of a frame,
//								  the height of a frame,
//								  amount of frames per animation sequence);
//
// 3) Set values by these functions: SetSpriteState(), SetSpritePosition(), SetSpriteSpeed();
//
// 4) To animate it, stick this function in your game loop:
//
//			AnimateSprite(the buffer, the sprite structure);
//
// 5) If you want to move it, call this: MoveSprite(the sprite structure);
//    The MoveSprite() function is something you will want to change most likely.
//    I just have it so if they hit the right side or bottom of the screen, they wrap.
//    Your program will differ in it's actions most likely (I hope so!)
//
// 6) Once you have swapped the buffers, you can call this to erase the sprite:
//
//			EraseSprite(the buffer, the sprite, the background image);
//
//    This takes a chunk from the background image and draws it over the sprite.
//    This is so you don't have to redraw the whole background every time.
//
// 7) Then, after you are done with your program, free it:  FreeSprite(the sprite structure)
//
// And that's pretty much it!
//
// *What Is Transparency???*
//
// If you go and look at the bitmap "monster.bmp", you will see that there is
// black all around the monster in each frame of animation.  Well, we can
// say that we only want to blit the colors that ARENT black.  The color
// just happens to be RGB (0, 0, 0) which is PURE black.  So when we call
// TransparentBlit() (this function is called in DisplayTransparentBitmap()) then
// we tell it that we want to ignore all the colors in the bitmap that have the
// RGB value of (0, 0, 0).  RGB is the Red Green Blue values that make up color.
// So now, when the bitmap is display, it doesn't show the black outlining in the frame,
// This is good because it would look like a blocky creature.
//
// To see the difference, Call DisplayPortionOfBitmap instead of DisplayTransparentBitmap.
// The creature will have all the black around him.  Once again, the transparent function
// have an unknown memory leak in it, which sucks because it is an awesome function.
// In another tutorial we will create our own transparent function.
