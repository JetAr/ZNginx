/*
	This tutorial is all about receiving mouse input in your Win32 application.  Specifically
	we'll go over how to get the current position of the mouse.  We'll get this information
	in the WinProc() by checking the WM_MOUSEMOVE message.

	The application is pretty simple.  Basically every time the mouse moves, we'll display
	it's current (x,y) position of the mouse in the center of the screen.  That's it!
	Nothing more and nothing less.  So without further ado, lets get coding.

    FillRect(hdc,&rect,(HBRUSH)GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH));

    // **NOTE**
    //
    // What EXACTLY is the client area of a window?  Well when you think
    // of a window, you should think of two RECT's that describe that window.  The first
    // is the WINDOW RECT.  This, as the name implies, encompasses the ENTIRE window.
    // The second is the CLIENT RECT.  This is the area of the window where "stuff" is
    // actually drawn.  The client area EXCLUDES the title bar and thin borders around the
    // window.  It's upper left corner always starts at (0,0) and is relative to the window.
    // For this app, the client rect is the rectangular area that's pure white and has
    // the mouse coordinates being displayed in it.

    char buffX[128] = {0}; // char buffer for the X position
    char buffY[128] = {0}; // char buffer for the Y position

    // Fill both buffers with the text
    sprintf(buffX,"X Pos = %d",xPos);
    sprintf(buffY,"Y Pos = %d",yPos);

    // Now here's where you math teacher turns out to be right!  To display the
    // text horizontally centered in the window, we're going to have to use a little algebra.
    // So lets think about this.  We basically want half of the text to the left of
    // the center of the window and half of the text to the right of the center of
    // the window so overall it will look perfectly centered.  Well that gives us this
    // equation:
    //
    //  xStart = centerX - (lengthOfText / 2)
    //  yStart = Whatever we choose, all we care is that the text is centered horizontally
    //
    // But that won't quite do it.  We forgot one thing, the width of each letter of
    // text.  So when we add that into the equation we get this:
    //
    //  xStart = centerX - ((lengthOfText / 2) * widthOfACharacter)
    //  yStart = Whatever we choose, all we care is that the text is centered horizontally
    //
    // Okay we have our equation, so now lets fill in the variables

    // First, we'll get the center of the window
    // Notice how we use the CLIENT rect to get the center (x,y) of the window
    int centerX = rect.right / 2;
    int centerY = rect.bottom / 2;

    // Next we'll get the "width of the text".  To do this we'll fill a TEXTMETRIC struct.
    // A TEXTMETRIC is a Win32 struct that holds a whole crap load of information about
    // a physical font.
    TEXTMETRIC textmetric;

    GetTextMetrics(hdc,&textmetric); // This fills "textmetric" with a bunch of information
    // about the current font.  Now since we didn't set
    // the font to anything in particular, this will be
    // filled with the "default font's" info.

    // We'll draw the "Mouse's x position first" so using our equation lets calculate
    // it's starting x-pos for drawing to the window.  You'll notice we use
    // the "tmAveCharWidth" variable of the TEXTMETRIC struct.  This gives us the average
    // width of a character drawn, which is just what we need.
    int start = centerX - ((strlen(buffX) / 2) * textmetric.tmAveCharWidth);

    // Okay now it's time to actually write out the text to the screen
    // We'll draw this slightly above the vertical center of the screen,
    // hence the (centerY - 25)
    TextOut(hdc, start, centerY - 25, buffX, strlen(buffX));

    // Now it's time to draw out the "Mouse's y position" so lets recalculate our starting
    // position
    start = centerX - ((strlen(buffY) / 2) * textmetric.tmAveCharWidth);

    // Draw it to the screen -- We'll draw this slightly below the vertical center of
    // the window
    TextOut(hdc, start, centerY + 25, buffY, strlen(buffY));

    ReleaseDC(hwnd,hdc); // Be sure to always free up your HDC

}

// More Mouse Movement --------------

/*	As promised, here's more on the "flags" that are filled every time the
	WinProc() receives a WM_MOUSEMOVE message.  It's important to
	note that "flags" (the WPARAM value) could contain any combination of
	the following:

	MK_CONTROL		Set if the ctrl key is down.
	MK_LBUTTON		Set if the left mouse button is down.
	MK_MBUTTON		Set if the middle mouse button is down.
	MK_RBUTTON		Set if the right mouse button is down.
	MK_SHIFT		Set if the shift key is down.

	So to determine if, say for instance, the crtl key is down, we would simply utilize our
	old friends the binary operators and do something like this:

	if(flags & MK_CONTROL)
		// Do stuff because ctrl key is down

	Well that's all she wrote for this chapter on mouse movement.  As always, any questions
	can be directed to the forums at www.GameTutorials.com
