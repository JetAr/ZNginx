//z 处理键盘输入，接受三个键 R G B
/*
	This tutorial is all about receiving keyboard input in your Win32 application.
	Windows provides multiple ways to receive keyboard input, but this tutorial
	focuses on a method to get the keyboard input inside of the WinProc().

	What we're going to do is pretty simple.  If you press the 'R' key we'll print "RED" to
	the window in the color red.  If you press the 'G' key, we'll print "GREEN" to the window
	in the color green.  And I bet you get the pattern for the 'B' key :)

	So without further ado, lets get coding.

    /*****

      NOTE:

    	In SetTextColor() we use the macro RGB()

    	RGB() is a Win32 macro that makes a COLORREF.  A COLORREF is a 32-bit value
    	that specifies an RGB color.  A COLORREF looks like this in hex:

    	0x00bbggrr

    	With bb == the blue component, gg == the green component, and rr == red component
    	which are each an unsigned value between 0 - 255

/*
	More on WM_CHAR ---

	You probably noticed that we did not do ANYTHING with the LPARAM part of the
	WM_CHAR message.  Well it's not that it doesn't include any information.  On the
	contrary, it's chucked full with useful information.  So here's the table of
	information you could get out of the LPARAM if it tickled your fancy.

	This following is the BIT values breakdown of the 32-bit LPARAM -- Be sure to check
	MSDN for any changes

	0 - 15	Specifies the repeat count for the current message. The value is the number of
			times the keystroke is auto-repeated as a result of the user holding down the key

	16 - 23	Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment
			manufacturer (OEM)

	   24	Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand alt and
			ctrl keys that appear on an enhanced 101-key or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1
			if it is an extended key otherwise it's 0

	25 - 28 Reserved

	   29	The context code. The value is 1 if the alt key is held down while
			the key is pressed otherwise it's 0

	   30	The previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down
			before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up

	   31	The transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released,
			or it's 0 if the key is being pressed
