void MoveCursorWithJoystick(LPARAM lParam)
{
    POINT cursorPos;										// This will hold the cursor position
    int x = 0, y = 0;										// These will hold the joystick coordinates

    // Here we store the current cursor position in our variable.
    // Since it changes the variable, we have to pass in the address.

    GetCursorPos(&cursorPos);								// This gets the current cursor position

    // Here comes the weird part.  Joystick coordinates range from 0 to 65535, with the
    // origin being the uper left corner.  So it works just like the window, where (0,0)
    // is the top left corner of the joystick coordinate system.  Instead of dealing
    // with really high numbers, we can bit shift the X and Y position down to a range of
    // 0 to 15.  In this case, we would then bit shift to the right to reduce the number.
    // Basically, for every bit shift to the right it adds a zero in front of the number,
    // and takes the very right most bit, whether it be 1 or zero.  Bit shifting to the right
    // once divides the number in half.  Likewise, bit shifting the number to the left once
    // doubles it.  Below, are dividing the number by 2 essentially 12 times.  Hopefully there
    // should be a graphical binary tutorial up on the site www.GameTutorials.com by now.

    // There is a windows macro called LOWORD() and HIWORD() which grabs the bottom bits
    // and top bits of 32-bit data type, which WPARAM and LPARAM are.  The X value is stored
    // in the LO bits of the lParam and the Y value is stored in the HI bits.  This allows
    // you to store numerous information in one variable.  Cool huh?

    x = LOWORD(lParam) >> 12;
    y = HIWORD(lParam) >> 12;

    // Now that we have the x and y value of the joystick movement from 0 to 15,
    // we can start moving the cursor position.  Generally, the X and Y value
    // will be around 7 and 8 when we aren't moving the joystick.  But, when we
    // move the joystick to the left the X value turns to 0.  When we move the
    // joystick to the right the X value goes to 15 (The highest possible).
    // It's the same for the Y value, if we move up on the joystick, the Y value,
    // goes to 0, where down makes the Y value go to 15.  In this simple case,
    // we just test those cases, but when you want more precision for movement,
    // you might want to make the range bigger than 0 to 15.  That way you can
    // test certain ranges instead of FULL LEFT or FULL RIGHT.  Sometimes you
    // can just move it slightly, so you would want to move slower than a full movement.

    // If we are holding LEFT, decrease the cursor X position by our acceleration
    // Else If we are holding RIGHT, increase the cursor X position by our acceleration
    if(x == 0)
        cursorPos.x -= CURSOR_SPEED;
    else if(x == 15)
        cursorPos.x += CURSOR_SPEED;

    // If we are holding UP, decrease the cursor Y position by our acceleration
    // Else If we are holding DOWN, increase the cursor Y position by our acceleration
    if(y == 0)
        cursorPos.y -= CURSOR_SPEED;
    else if(y == 15)
        cursorPos.y += CURSOR_SPEED;

    // If we aren't touching the movement, don't change the position of the cursor.

    // Here we set the new cursor position
    SetCursorPos(cursorPos.x, cursorPos.y);

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// BE SURE TO INCLUDE winmm.lib TO YOUR PROJECT IN ORDER TO USE THE JOYSTICK API
//
// So, now we know how to do some simple things with they joystick.
// This program is very simple, but I wanted to not cloud the basics
// with a neat program.  See if you can make it so when you hit the
// first button it draws a pixel where the cursor is in the window, then
// when you press the second button it draws a line between the 2 points.
// That is what I wanted to do, but simple is better :)
//
// Also, when we speak of "joystick" that could mean gamepad too. That is
// what I use, a 4 button Gravis GamePad.
//
// The steps to allowing joystick support is easy:
//
// 1) Call joyGetNumDevs() to see if we have at least 1 device.
//
// 2) Call joySetCapture() to initialize the desired joystick we are using.
//
// 3) Check the MM_JOY1BUTTONDOWN and MM_JOY1MOVE messages.  The lParam is
//    the X and Y coordinates and the wParam is the buttons pressed.
//
// That's pretty much it!  COoOOoOoOl huh?  Let us know at GameTutorials
// if this tutorial was helpfull to you.  Your suggestions are always welcome.
