//		$Program:		Display Bitmaps (DIB)				
//										
//		$Description:	Reads in a bitmap from a file and creates a DIB section
//										
//**********************************************************************************//

Files:  	DisplayBitmaps.cpp (The Source File containing the window and bitmap code)
	DisplayBitmap.h (The Header File containing the window and bitmap function definitions)
	DisplayBitmaps.vcxproj  (The VC++ Project File holding the project info)
	DisplayBitmaps.sln  (The Solution File holding the solution info)
	Bitmap.bmp (The Bitmap File to be displayed)

Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 (version 8.0) just click on the
		<Program Name>.vcxproj file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.cpp.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .cpp extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it
 will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		the Win32 program should pop up. :)
