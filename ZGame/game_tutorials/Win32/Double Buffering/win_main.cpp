  This tutorial is all about double buffering.  So what's that you ask?  Well to really
  explain double buffering it's important that first you know what "normal" single buffering
  is all about.  So a quick lesson in what's going on when you make a window.

	When you call CreateWindowEx() what you get is a HWND (a handle to a window).
	You can think of this HWND as a pointer (cause it is) that points to ALL the information
	one could ever want about the window.

	Using the HWND you can get an HDC (handle to a device context) for the window.  You can
	think of HDC as a pointer (cause it is) that points to ALL the GRAPHICAL information
	about a window.  When you create a window you get a block of memory that you can think
	of as a "bitmap" (HBITMAP) where ALL the drawing/blitting/graphical stuff will take
	place.  The HDC acts as a way for you to modify the bitmap in memory that is created
	when we make a window.  This bitmap is referred to as the "single buffer" or "front buffer"
	and it is literally all the pixels that you see on your monitor.  Every time you
	draw to the front buffer, the window (and hence the monitor) will instantly be updated.

  So.... this brings us to double buffering.  Double buffering is the technique in where
  you copy the front buffer of your window so now you have TWO buffers, (the new buffer is
  commonly referred to as a "back buffer") and do all your drawing to the copied buffer (the back
  buffer) FIRST.  Once all drawing is complete, you draw the finished back buffer to the
  front buffer.

  What does this do for us?  Well it avoids tearing and other graphical glitches.  When we
  draw to the front buffer (or really any buffer for that matter) eventually down in the
  bowls of the CPU/GPU what happens is a pixel by pixel copy of our "source image" to our
  "destination image" (our monitor).  Now if your only doing a small amount of rendering, then
  drawing directly to the front buffer is no problem and your eye is too slow to visually
  catch the changes.  But when you're dealing with games (of even a small magnitude) there
  is a butt-load of drawing that takes place.  If you try to just pump everything to the front
  buffer, your eye is fast enough to pick up the "artifacts" (graphical glitches) that will
  occur from doing so.  Thus we draw everything first to our back buffer, then draw our
  completed, full rendered scene to the front buffer so no visual anomalies occur.

  Hopefully that enlightens you on what double buffering is all about.  But do not fret if
  you are still confused.  A few lines down you'll see a line of code that looks like this:

	#define DOUBLE_BUFFER 1

  If you change the '1' to a '0' double buffering will be turned off and you can see as
  plain as day why you need it :)


  Now before we get started, lets talk about what we are going to do.  It's pretty
  straight forward.  First we'll make our window.  Second, we'll create our double buffer.
  Third we're gonna load a bitmap.  Then we'll allow users to move the bitmap around with
  the mouse.  Each time it's moved we'll draw it to our back buffer and then update our
  front buffer.  You should see a smooth, seamless bitmap being moved around inside of the
  window.

  And with that, it's time to get coding

/*
	Hopefully you can see that without a doubt, something double buffered looks better
	than something singled buffer.  However, double buffering IS NOT the end all be all
	solution to all the possible graphic mishaps out there.  It's just one tool in the tool
	belt of graphic programmers that should be used to make games/applications look prettier.

	Also note that if you move the mouse wildly around you may ask yourself, "Why does
	this look choppy, I thought we were double buffering?", Well unfourtantely the answer to
	that question is, "It should look choppy %)" -- Since we are not doing any syncing of
	the mouse movement and the drawing to the screen it's possible to produce some
	"choppy bitmap movement".  But that is a whole other topic...

	As always, questions, comments or quandaries should be posted directly to
	www.GameTutorials.com
