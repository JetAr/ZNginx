// In this final tutorial we will implement the save and load features.  This means
// that we will be able to save the position of the player in the game so that they
// can quit and then load the exact same position in the story as they were before.
// This means that we will save the player's position, which pa they are on, their
// inventory, their party members, and finally, the action keys that were set during
// the game.  We do this by simply saving all this data to a ".sav" file, which we
// will create.  This will be in binary, and very similar to our .map saving method.
//
// *So how do you save and load?*
//
// To load or save a game, you just need to go to the main menu (ESC) and choose
// "save" or "load" from the menu options with the left mouse button.  This will
// then bring up a prompt that allows you to type in the saved game file, or the
// file you want to save.  You don't need to type .sav at the end of the file
// name since it will be added automatically to the file.  This goes for saving
// and loading.
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Toggle the main menu (Or escapes a menu)
// Left Mouse Button - This chooses the options from the main menu
//					   - If you click twice on an item in the inventory menu it will
//					     bring up a prompt to use, drop or cancel.
// Space Bar - This toggles on and off the stats screen in the bottom left of the map
// To Attack - Run into a monster with the arrow keys
//
// We added 2 new files, SaveLoad.cpp and SaveLoad.h.  Not much code was changed
// or added in other files, except the player files and a little bit in the map
// files.  Nothing was added to Main.cpp except a global g_SaveLoad object.
//
// Let's go look at some save/load code.
//
//

// This is the main object that we use to load and save our character files
CSaveLoad g_SaveLoad;

// Create our global variables for our open file dialog box
OPENFILENAME g_OpenInfo = {0};
char g_szFileName[MAX_PATH] = {0};

//////////// *** NEW *** ////////// *** NEW *** ///////////// *** NEW *** ////////////////////


CMap g_Map;										// This stores our global map object
CPlayer g_Player;								// This stores our global player object
CInput g_Input;									// This is the global input object
CMenu g_Menu;									// This is our global menu object
CFmod g_Music;									// This is our global music object
CBuffer g_Buffer;								// Create a buffer for the main window
CAction g_ActionKeys;							// This is our global action key object
CShop g_Shop;									// This is our global shop object
POINT g_cursorPos = {0};						// The current mouse cursor position

HWND  g_hWnd;									// This is a global handle for the window

// *Quick Notes*
//
// In this file we added the global g_SaveLoad object, as well as the
// windows menu support for saving and loading.  Either the player
// can use the windows menus, or hit escape and use the main game
// menu that we created with bitmaps.  From here we can jump
// directly to Map.cpp to see the next small additions.  To use the
// windows dialog boxes for saving and loading, we needed to also add
// the g_OpenInfo object, and be sure to initialize it in Init().
//
// This is the end of the Rpg tutorial series.  The topics that
// were gone over in this tutorial series should have been simple
// enough to implement them in your own projects.  Of course, these
// are just simple ways to implement in a game, but do not reflect
// the most efficient or bug free.  To make the code more robust
// you will need to add the rest.  This should have been a HUGE push
// to get you on that road. The sky is the limit!
//
// Good job on getting through all of the tutorials in this series.
// You should be pretty excited to make your own project now.  Go for it!
