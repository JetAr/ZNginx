	Now this tutorial is titled "path finding" but a more fitting name would probably be
	"maze solving" (you'll see what I mean :) -- The path finding technique that is discussed
	is called the "Right Hand Rule" -- This technique works like this:

		1)  First you pick an arbitrary direction to head in (either NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST)
		2)  If you can TURN RIGHT (ie a open space is to your right, which is obviously dependent
			on what direction you are facing) you turn right AND MOVE FORWARD one space
		3)  If you CAN NOT turn right, move forward in the current direction you are facing
		4)  Keep doing #2 and #3 UNTIL you CAN NOT turn right OR move forward
		5)  Then TURN LEFT and go back to #2
		6)  When you've found your destination, you are done!

	What this does, if you can visualize it, is places a person in a maze with their
	right hand placed on the wall they are next to -- Now no matter how they move, their
	right hand will not come off of the wall, thus ensuring they will eventually go down
	every corridor and valid path of the maze.  Which of course means they will eventually
	find the "exit".

	Now this "path finding" technique certainly WILL NOT find you the quickest OR the shortest
	path, but it will get you to your destination sooner or later.

	It is also important to note that I've sectioned off the "drawing code" and "window code"
	to there own seperate classes.  By now, you are gurus at doing both, so less explanation
	is needed and more comments can be added to the path finiding %)

	Finally, there are some things to consider that WILL BREAK this algorithm that I list at
	the	bottom of this file -- But for now on with the show :)

/* Path Find To This:

	Now the "right hand rule" really is a great way to "solve a maze" -- It is path finding
	because as you saw, eventually our "entity" reached it's destination, but what the
	right hand rule is really good for is having enemies in a game say, "keep walking a dungeon"

	The right hand rule breaks down if your maze (your map) has any areas that are
	circular or loop -- What will happen is the entity will keep traveling in that circular
	path forever, so if you're going to use the right hand rule, your level (or map or whatever)
	MUST NOT have any "circular loops"

	As always questions and comments can be directed to www.GameTutorials.com
