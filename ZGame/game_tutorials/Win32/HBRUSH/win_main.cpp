	Okay what we're going to do here is a little drawing using an HBRUSH.  Windows refers
	to all objects that can be used to draw things in a window collectively as GDI
	(Graphic Device Interface) objects.  To us, a HBRUSH is nothing more than a handle to a brush.
	So all that's really important to know up front is that we can draw stuff by using HBRUSHs.
	But lets dig a bit deeper...

	In Win32 brushes are used to paint shapes.  So if we wanted to draw a rectangle to the
	screen, using a Win32 API, the color contained inside the bounding area of the rectangle would
	be filled in by whatever brush is currently selected.

	Brushes are associated with a device context.  A device context is a pointer that lets us
	talk to hardware devices, such as the graphics card, without knowing anything about the
	hardware device.  In this tutorial we will get the device context of our window and
	associate different brushes with it, drawing different rectangles to the screen.

	So without further ado, lets draw.

    // the next line of code first associates the HBRUSH with our HDC (remember you
    // can only have ONE brush associated with an HDC at a time).  Next it returns
    // to us the currently selected brush in the HDC (again by default Windows gives
    // us a brush).  We store that in "oldBrush", because when we are done using our
    // brush we need to put back the brush that was already there.
    oldBrush = (HBRUSH)SelectObject(gHDC,hbrush);
    assert(oldBrush != NULL); // If SelectObject() fails, it returns NULL

    // Draw a random rectangle from (0,0) to some a random (x,y) inside of
    // the window.  When drawing the rectangle, the inside area will get filled
    // with the brush we've selected.  The outside border will get drawn with
    // the default pen which is a thin black pen.
    Rectangle(gHDC, 0, 0, rand()%gRect.right, rand()%gRect.bottom);

    // Okay we've drawn a rectangle, fantastic.  Now we get to be good
    // Windows children and put back all of our toys.

    // First we put back the original brush associated with our HDC
    SelectObject(gHDC,oldBrush);

    // Now when we called CreateSolidBrush() a brush was dynamically allocated for us.
    // We need to free that memory up.  To do this we call DeleteObject()
    DeleteObject(hbrush);

/*
	Brush with the law...

	Yes Windows has laws about brushes, and matter of factly, GDI (Graphic Device Interface) objects in
	general.  This general set of laws is the following:

		1)  Create the object
		2)  Select it into the device context you are using
		3)	Draw things
		4)  When finished, put back the object that was there before

	If you follow those rules, you shouldn't get any ill effects or memory leaks when
	using GDI objects.

	If you have any questions or want to talk code, stop by the forums at www.GameTutorials.com.
