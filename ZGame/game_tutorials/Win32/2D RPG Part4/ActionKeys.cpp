// This is where all the cut scenes and action key handling will be done.
// Only 2 of these functions are action key functions, HandleKey() and HandleMaps().
// The rest of these functions are just for the game's story, etc...  You will
// delete most of them when you make your own game/project.  The method of doing a
// cut scene is simple.  We just make a separate function that writes a bunch
// of dialog to the screen, with pauses between each one.  We then can use functions
// to move the players or monsters/npcs which will make it look like an animated cut
// scene.  We do a cut scene when Quinn saves his brother.  Nothing is hard, tricky
// or complicated about these functions below.
//
// This is how the action keys work.  We have an array, m_actionKeys, that stores
// about 1000 slots for action keys.  We then set a certain index into that array
// as a key.  For instance, the kTrendorSceneKey is 5.  When this key is set to something
// other than 0, it means that we have already done the first Trendor cut scene.  That way
// when we walk into our house and talk to Trendor, there isn't always a huge dialog scene.
// However, we don't always need to set the key, like in the case of a shop keeper.  The
// shop keepers key is 555.  That means when ever we talk to an npc, we will first check
// if it has a action key.  If it does, we then have an if statement that handles this key.
// We don't set this index into our action key array because we always want to be able to
// buy from the shops.  So the key is just to tell us what type of npc it is.  It has
// nothing to do with the action key since we never set or check that index.  We just check
// the number of the npc's attached action key.  We will get into shops in the next tutorial.

    // him into a player, then delete the Npc on the map.

    // Now we need to create a new player dynamically, otherwise it will cause memory
    // problems later.  We will free this later in the CPlayer deconstructor.  After
