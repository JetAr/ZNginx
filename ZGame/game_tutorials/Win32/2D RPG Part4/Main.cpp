//////////// *** NEW *** ////////// *** NEW *** ///////////// *** NEW *** ////////////////////

// In this tutorial we added a ton of new features for our game.  Particularly, we added
// support for fighting monsters, action keys, cut scenes, and ending (You can now win
// AND lose the game!), and finally, we added the ability to add a new player to your
// party.  There is a lot of code to go over in this tutorial, but sit back and hopefully
// that funny/silly sound that plays when you pick up items will keep you giggling long
// enough to finish this tutorial :)
//
// There is a lot of new additions, so let's first start with the cut scenes that deal
// with the actual game.  The first cut scene,or long dialog scene, happens when we go
// into our house.  Our friend Trendor and our sick brother are there.  When we talk
// Trendor we go through a bunch of dialog that tells us the point of the game.  Trendor
// says that he would like to help, but you first have to go find and talk to the
// Governor to see if you can get his permission to cross the bridge to enter the new
// world.  That is where you can find the sage who has a potion that can possibly cure
// your brother's disease.  If you don't have the permission,the guard won't let you pass.
// After you talk with the Governor, you can go talk to Trendor again and he will join
// your party, which will help you fight creatures more effectively.  Eventually, you
// get enough experience (100) to prove to the Governor that you can defend yourself in
// the new world.  The guard will then let you pass and you can find the sage.  When you
// get to the sage, there is a long cut scene.  Quinn will receive the potion and upon
// coming home to his brother there is a cut scene that shows Quinn walk up to his brother
// and give him the potion.  There is a small dialog scene and the game is over.  All of
// this story is done using action keys.  Love'em, learn'em, marry'em.  Okay,... maybe
// hold off on the engagement, but you know what I mean :)
//
// *So, how do I attack a monster?*
//
// In order to attack a monster, you need to run into them.  If they run into you first
// then they will attack you.  But, you need to be careful.  Monsters are smart.  If
// you are in their radius they will come and attack you.  Don't get too close to them
// or you will most likely get attacked.
//
// *So what are these action keys?*
//
// We use "action keys" to add special cases to our game.  Since we want to allow
// cut scenes and special things to happen which make our game, we need ways to
// tell the code that we want to do something special.  For instance, if we want
// Trendor to be added to our party, we give him an action key in our map editor when
// we placed Trendor to the map as an npc.  We then check the action keys of each npc
// and see if we have a special case that needs to be handles.  This also works
// for shop keepers.  We will use the action key 555 to signal our code that this
// npc is a special npc which sells goods.  We can then program a shop for that npc
// when the player talks to them.  This will be in the next tutorial.  Not just action
// keys will signify this, but we also do checks every time we open a new map.  We do
// a special check that sees if we need to do a cut scene (like the sick brother scene).
// After the cut scene is over, we set an index of our action key array that says
// that scene is already over, so don't do it again.  This is a simple way to keep track
// of what has happened in the game.  It makes it easy to save the game because we just
// need to save the action key array and we saved the game state.  Cool huh?  Of course
// we still need to save the player's data and inventory, etc.
//
// Since there is much to cover, you will better understand how these new features work
// by just jumping into the code.  We will explain further as we come across these features.
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Toggle the main menu (Or escapes a menu) and escape/continue dialog
// Left Mouse Button - This chooses the options from the main menu
//					   - If you click twice on an item in the inventory menu it will
//					     bring up a prompt to use, drop or cancel.
// Space Bar - This toggles on and off the stats screen in the bottom left of the map.
//			   We can also use this key to escape/continue dialog.
// To Attack - Run into a monster with the arrow keys
//
//

// This is our global action keys array.  This stores all the game situations and
// special cases.  We use this for cut scenes and story progression, along with shops (later).
