////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// *Quick Notes*
//
// We added our defines for the action keys and also created the
// CAction class which handles the action keys and special events.
// When ever you want to add a cut scene or event, put the action
// key ID in this file.  Also, you will notice we have a start and
// end ID for items.  This is because when we place an item on the
// map, we should use the action keys between kItemsKey and
// kLastItemKey.  This makes sure that we don't overlap action keys.
// Remember, when you place an item on the map and want it to go
// away after you pick it up and not reappear each time the player
// enters the map, be sure to give it an action key when placing it
// on the map in the map editor.
