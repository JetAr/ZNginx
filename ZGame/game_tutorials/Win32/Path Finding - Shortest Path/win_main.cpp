	This program shows one way you can have an "AI character" find and travel the
	shortest path between two "points".

	So no point of beating around the bush, how does one exactly find the shortest
	path between two points?  Well actually it's pretty self-explanatory.  What we
	going to do is start at our starting point (naturally) and build ALL possible
	paths until we reach our destination.  Which ever path leads us to the destination
	first is obviously the shortest one.  Sound horrible inefficient?  Well unfortunately,
	there is no better algorithm (in the worst case) for finding the "shortest path" compared
	to finding all possible paths between two points.

	If you think about it that makes sense.  Because lets say you have 10 paths to
	get from A to B.  Well the only way you know which one of those 10 is the SHORTEST is to
	know the "distances" of all 10 paths.  Then you could quickly compare and figure
	out the shortest.  So being we have no idea of how many possible paths to the destination
	there are AND we don't know the distances of any of these possible paths, what we are going
	to do is make and store EVERY possible path until we reach our destination.

	To accomplish this will use a "breadth-first" approach.  The breadth-first search
	is a common pathing algorithm.  It simply works like this.  First we check all the
	cells connected to our starting cell.  If none of them are the destination, we check all
	the cells connected to the cells connected to our starting cell.  We'll keep doing this
	pattern until we find our destination.  Okay, okay I'll do an ASCII diagram %)

	* = Open Cell
	~ = Visited Cell
	S = Start Cell
	D = Dest Cell

	Fist we have our start and destination cell:

	D***
	****
	**S*
	****

	On our FIRST path find attempt in a breath-first search we'd check these
	cells first (this assumes we can only move north, east, west, and south):

	D***		// So the numbers here are in order from checking the surrounding
	**1*		// cells in clockwise order -- Which direction you start with OR the
	*4S2		// order you check the surrounding cells really isn't important.  For
	**3*		// this example we'll check NORTH first and travel in a clockwise order.


	On our SECOND path find attempt in a breath-first search we'd check these
	cells first:

	D*1*
	*3~2		// Again, the numbers here are in order from checking the surrounding cells
	*~S~		// in clockwise order -- Notice how we start with the cell that was
	**~*		// the first cell we checked last time

	On our THIRD path find attempt in a breath-first search we'd check these
	cells first:

	D*~*		// From the #2 cell from our first path find attempt there's only one
	*~~~		// surrounding cell to check.  So we check that, it's not it and we'd move on
	*~S~		// to the #3 cell from our first path find attempt.  This pattern keeps
	**~1		// continuing until the destination is found.

	That pretty much explains the concept of a breadth-first search in a nutshell.

	So using a breadth-first approach, we'll begin at the starting cell making "paths"
	from the starting cell towards the destination path.  We'll construct every possible
	path, ending a path only when we reach a dead end or the destination.  Whichever
	path we've constructed reaches the destination first is our shortest path.

	It is important to note, that this does NOT mean that this is the ONLY shortest path.
	There could be multiple	paths that are the same minimum distance to get from "cell A"
	to "cell B" but this algorithm guarantees to give us a shortest path, if a path exists
	at all.

	Feeling overwhelmed already?  Hopefully not, but if so just keep reading %)
	The toughest thing to grasp with this tutorial (as far as I'm concerned) is the
	"tricky" STL syntax we use %)

	**NOTE** If you are NOT comfortable with the concepts of a "queue" and a "stack"
			 you should brush up on those concepts before reading this tutorial


	Before we really get started, lets quickly go over the controls for this application:

	Left click the mouse to set a solid square or take away a solid square.
	This allows you to build your own "maze" at runtime.

	Right click the mouse to set your starting position.  Right click the mouse again
	to set your destination position.

	Press the space bar to invoke the "path find" from your start position to your
	destination position.

/*	CHALLENGE:

	Change the path finding so you can travel in 8 directions (N, NW, NE, E, SE, SW, W)

	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	Well that's how you find the shortest path (you did already read the whole tutorial right?)
	Finding the shortest path can be extremely handy and useful depending on the game you
	are creating, however, don't expect to look at any Quake code and see this algorithm used.
	For	games that already chew up alot of processing power just making things look	pretty,
	path points system(s) are usually the way to go (a path point system is where
	an AI bot follows predetermined paths).

	As always, any questions or quandries, post 'em at www.gametutorials.com
