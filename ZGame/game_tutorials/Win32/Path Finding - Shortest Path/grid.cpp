// Here's where all the path finding goodness resides.  The pathFind() method will
// determine and fill "path_nodes" with the a shortest path from the "start cell" to
// the "destination cell" -- So lets go over how we are going to implement it:
/*
	We begin at whatever our start position is -- From there (in order) we will
	check the north, west, east, and south "cells".  Additionally each time we are checking
	these surrounding cells we are building paths from the starting cell that includes
	these cells.  So assuming that ALL four cells where open, and NONE of these cells
	were the destination, we'd have four distinct paths that lead out from our start cell.

	So we've starting building four distinct paths from our start cell... What now?  Well
	for each path we start to build we'll add it to a local variable "master_list".  This
	is a queue of stacks.  If you are unfamiliar with what a queue or stack is, this is where
	you stop reading this tutorial and brush up on those concepts, otherwise chances are good
	that you will become hopelessly lost.

	The "master_list", as aforementioned, is a queue of stacks -- We're using STL so we
	don't have to worry about the implementation of the queue or the stack, all we have to do
	is use it.  Each stack in our queue will be a stack of "cells" that lead away from our
	start cell.  The first time through the loop (assuming all the north, west, east and south
	cells are open) we'd have FOUR distinct stacks of cells leading out of the start cell.  It
	would look something like this:

	QUEUE[0] = { STACK["North Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }		// Top of queue
	QUEUE[1] = { STACK["West Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[2] = { STACK["East Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[3] = { STACK["South Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }		// Bottom of queue

	The next time through the loop we'll pop off the TOP stack of our queue (the stack
	containing the start cell and the "north adjacent cell") -- Then we'd check to
	see if we can move to ANY of the adjacent cells to the "north adjacent cell"
	Lets assume we can move to the north, west, and east cell (we obviously can't move
	to the south cell because that's the start cell and we've all ready visited it)
	Then what we'd have is 3 NEW paths that are added to the master list.  It would then
	look something like this:

	// N == the cell NORTH of the starting cell

	QUEUE[0] = { STACK["West Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }			// Top of queue
	QUEUE[1] = { STACK["East Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[2] = { STACK["South Cell"] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[3] = { STACK["North of N"] [N] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[4] = { STACK["West of N"] [N] ["Start Cell"] }
	QUEUE[5] = { STACK["East of N"] [N] ["Start Cell"] }		// Bottom of queue

	Basically the pattern continues in this fashion until the destination is reached
	or the "master_list" becomes empty signifying there is NO path from the start cell
	to the destination cell.

	This is all really wordy and high level.  So if your eyes glazed over when you were
	reading it, don't worry so did mine :) -- Hopefully it will make some more sense
	when you read the implementation
