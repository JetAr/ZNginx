	Collision ---

		Without collision, you limit the types of games you can make --
		With the ability to do collision SO many things are possible.  For instance,
		you can have planes that shoot bullets, and when those bullets COLLIDE with other
		planes they can explode.

		So what this tutorial does is show a BASIC, SIMPLE way to do collision.  This is
		certainly NOT the best way to collision, it's merely an introduction to the
		behemoth subject named "Collision".

/*	So how do like collision?  Well I'm sure you've seen that doing it this way sorta sucks.
	If you move the mouse quickly (from left to right say) and you movable square is on the
	right of "solid object", it could "collide" a distance away from the actual "solid object"

	Also if you move the "movable square" from left to right over the "solid square" you'll notice
	once you pass over the square it kinda just "hops" from one side to the other --

	So how do we get rid of this nasty feature??????

	Well for starters -- If a collision is detected you could set the upper-left coordinate
	of the movable square.  You would use the intersectRect (which we said we didn't care about)
	to calculate how much over "the movable square" is and then set the upper-left corner
	coordinates	of the movable square depending on these amounts.

	Also if we don't do mouse input, but keyboard input instead -- We can move the square pixel
	by pixel in a given direction (up, down, left, right) -- We wouldn't have to worry about
	flying from one side of a solid object to another 'cause we'd only be moving one pixel at
	a time.  If you switch to the keyboard input method, Tetris shouldn't be too big of a stretch :)

	I'll leave that as a challenge to you :)

	But as usual if you're having trouble let us at www.GameTutorials.com know --

	Happy Colliding %)
