// In this tutorial we will add the functionality for our inventory system.  This mean
// that we will need to add support for picking up items, dropping items, and adding
// equipment to the player like a weapon, armor, etc.  Since we already made a simple
// menu system in the last tutorial, we can use that to create an inventory screen
// to manage our items and such that we pick up.  In this menu we will program the
// options to add equipment to the player, as well as the option to use or drop an
// item.
//
// You can find some items inside the game in your house.  When you pick them up and leave
// the room, they will reappear again if you go back into the house.  This will be fixed later.
// To pick up an item you just need to walk right over it.  It will do it automatically.
// You just hit ESC and choose the "Inventory" option from the main menu.  This is of
// course done with the mouse.  This will bring up the inventory menu.  You can then click
// on an item and see it's stats at the bottom of the inventory menu.  If you click again
// on the same item it will bring up a prompt that will ask you if you want to use the
// item, drop the item or cancel.  If the item is a type of equipment then when you use
// it that will add it to your equipment that the player is wearing.  This is seen on
// the left hand side of the inventory menu under the headings of "Head", "Chest", "Weapon",
// and "Feet".  However, if the item is not a type of equipment, then it will add
// (or subtract) to your current stats, depending on the item's stats.  When you equip
// something, the stats associated with that item will be added to the player.  When you
// change equipment, those stats will be removed from the player and the new stats of the
// new item will be added.  You might make some items or equipment bad to wear, or not
// as effective.  For instance, a bad mushroom item will actually take away health when
// used.  Also, maybe a sword might help you with strength, but actually have a negative
// effect on your protection stat.
//
// Remember, you can always hit ESC to exit out of menus (or go back to the previous menu).
// We add a silly little sound when ever the player picks up an item.  Feel free to giggle
// every time you hear it :)
//
// Another addition in this tutorial is a little stats screen that shows up at the bottom
// of the screen.  This tells the player their health, level, experience and gold.  You can
// increase these stats as you fight monsters, but that won't be setup until a later tutorial.
// To turn on and off this stats menu you can just press the space bar.  This can get in
// the way of game play, so you wouldn't always want it on.
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Toggle the main menu (Or escapes a menu) and escapes/continues dialog
// Left Mouse Button - This chooses the options from the main menu
//					   - If you click twice on an item in the inventory menu it will
//					     bring up a prompt to use, drop or cancel.
// Space Bar - This toggles on and off the stats screen in the bottom left of the map
//			   Space bar also escapes/continues dialog.
//
// Let's go pick up some items!  (Note that when you pick up an item and leave the map
// it's back there on the map.  When we get into saving and loading of maps we will discuss
// how to get rid of this)

// *Quick Notes*
//
// In Main.cpp we added a check for space bar, which toggles on and
// off the stats menu at the bottom of the screen.  We also needed to
// check for items on the ground, so we added CheckForItem() in that
// same function, right above checking for exits and npcs.
//
// You can now jump over to Map.cpp to see the new additions we added there.
// The next tutorial will go over action keys and cut scenes, as well as
// fighting monsters and gaining levels and other stats.
