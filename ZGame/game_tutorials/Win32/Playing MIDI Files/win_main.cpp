/*  What this tutorial is about is how to load and play midi files --

	This app is set up to only play the midi file associated with it, but with
	not to much trouble we could set it up to load ANY midi file and act a little more like
	WinAmp.

	So lets get going so we can experience and remember the sweet, sweet sound of MIDI

        /* What is going on here???  Okay step by step:
        1) First parameter says that we are creating a predefined type of a window.
           A button in this case.
        2) Second parameter says the name of the button that will be displayed
        3) 3rd parameter says this "button window" will belong to a parent window
           which means they can share a WinProc() same idea how children share a house
           with their parents.  At anytime the parents can decide to redecorate and the
           kids are just going to have to except it, OR ELSE!
           WS_VISIBLE means we can see the button and BS_PUSHBUTTON means it's a push button (when you click it, it will look as if you pushed it in)
        4) The first two CW_USEDEFAULT's say place this button at a default X and Y location in my window
        5) The second two CW_USEDEFAULT's say give this button a default width and default height, in that order
        6) Specifies who the parent is -- It's answering the question "Who's your daddy?"
        7) A way to specify (just a number) our button from other buttons -- It's the button's ID
        8) Got no clue... No just kidding -- First you should look at the CreateWindow()
           in WinMain(),  see how we passed in hinstance there.  Well we need to pass that
           in again here.  But if you look at the WinProc() you'll see that we're not
           passing in that varialbe, so we DON'T have access to it.  Well this is only partially true.
           If you just tried to pass in "hinstance" it would not compile.  But we do have
           the "hinstance", it's hidden within the "lparam" -- By typecasting the "lparam" to
           a LPCREATESTRUCT we can extract the "hinstance"
        9) NULL -- don't care, this parameter is used to pass "extra information" but we don't have any to pass
