/*
	Background Scrolling --

	This program is going to do two things:

		1) We are going to "tile" our background image so that it fills the window
		2) We are going to scroll our background -- It will go from top to bottom

	Now with not to much more work, you could put a spacship on the screen that is
	controlled by the mouse -- Add asteroids to avoid and you got yourself an Atari game!

	But I'll leave that as a challenge for you %)

	Within we're just going to cover the concept of scrolling a background image

              Remember we are scrolling down, so the "hole" will always be at the top
        BKGRD_WID -- Same as always
        gYScroll -- We only need to blit the height of the bitmap we've scrolled down
        win_obj.bmp_dc -- Same as always
        0 -- Same as always (starting at left most position in bitmap)
        (BKGRD_HGT - gYScroll) -- Okay this may look tricky but it's not, if we moved down
        						 one line of pixels (meaning gYScroll would equal 1) then the
        						 line of pixels we want to draw at the top of window is the
        						 LAST line of pixels in our bitmap (this way the seamless
        						 textures still appear seamless) -- Since our BKGRD_HGT
        						 is 150 the last row would be 149 which is (150 - 1) which
        						 is what BKGRD_HGT - gYScroll is equivalent to :)
        SRCCOPY -- Same as always (When we blit, do a source copy)
