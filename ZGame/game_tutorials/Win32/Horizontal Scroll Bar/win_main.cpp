        	kSentence is the pointer to the string.  It points to the first letter in
        	the character string.  So if we add 1 to kSentence, it will point to the
        	second letter in the string.  If we add 2 to kSentence, it will point to the
        	third letter, and so on and so forth.  Hence we pass (kSentence + xPos) as the
        	starting character in the sentence when we draw it to the screen.

        	Lastly, we specify the number of characters to draw as strlen(kSentence) - xPos.
        	This is because we want to draw the entire sentence minus the amount we've scrolled
        	to the right.

		GetScrollBarInfo() Retrieves information about a scroll bar
		GetScrollInfo() Retrieves a scroll bar's parameters
		EnableScrollBar() Enables/Disables a scroll bar
