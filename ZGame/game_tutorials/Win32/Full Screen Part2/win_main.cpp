/*
	Inside of this tutorial we are going to switch to and from full screen with a menu present.
	To do this we will have to do a couple of things.  First we'll need to get rid of the
	menu when full screened and put it back when in windowed mode.  Next, we'll need to
	dynamically update the style of the window depending on if we are full screen or
	windowed.

	There are two ways to change to full screen.  Either select "On" under the full screen
	menu or press the F1 key.

	Okay we know what we want to do, so lets go do it!

        // whatever they display settings are that are stored in the registry and get
        // loaded on system startup.

        // Now we will put the window's menu

        // changing, it can get embarrased and not want to show itself.
        ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOW);

        // And that's it.  We could put the window back in it's original position
        // before we toggled to full screen, but for simplicity sake, we'll just
        // leave at (0,0).  You can always drag it wherever you want %)
        gFullScreen = false; // Set flag appropriately
        return true;
    }
}

// Wrap up...
//
//	Changing to/from full screen can be a useful mechanic for your application.  Additionally,
//	you may want to add the functionality to do a full screen that changes your window to
//	whatever the current resolution is.
