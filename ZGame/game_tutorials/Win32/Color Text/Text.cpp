//z 为text添加颜色，通过调用 SetTextColor 。
// When working with windows we want to print text sometimes, but black text
// can be boring after a while.  This tutorials shows you how to add color
// to your text.  We have a nice function called SetTextColor() that takes
// a RGB value (red green blue) for the desired color.  Go ahead and check
// out the tutorial below.


#include <windows.h>										// We need to include windows.h
#include <stdio.h>											// Include stdio.h for the basics

// Here is our WndProc for handling messages we receive from the operating system
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);

// Our WinMain function
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR szCmdLine, int iCmdShow)
{
    HWND hwnd; // The handle to our window
    MSG msg; // The structure to hold the message from the OS
    WNDCLASSEX wndclass = {0}; // The window class

    // Init all the important fields in the WNDCLASSEX
    wndclass.cbSize = sizeof(wndclass); // Size of WNDCLASSEX

    UpdateWindow(hwnd); // Update (paint) the window

    while(1) // Loop forever

        // Get any messages the OS has for us

        break;

    // This message is sent to the WndProc after the windows size has changed
    case WM_SIZE:

        break;

    // This message is sent to the WndProc when the window needs to be repainted.  This might be if
    // we moved the window, resized it, or maximized it, or if another window was covering ours.
    case WM_PAINT:
        // This is how we get an HDC to paint with.  BeginPaint() passes back an hdc and fills
        // in the paintStruct structure.  The paintStruct holds optional information on how to paint
        // but all we really care about is getting the HDC of the window so we can draw
        // to the window.
        hdc = BeginPaint(hwnd, &paintStruct);

        // Here we pass in the hdc of our window and our textInfo into GetTextMetrics().
        // This fills in textInfo with all the font info for the window such as height,
        // width, spacing, etc, etc.  At any one time, an HDC can have one font
        // associated with it.  By default Windows assigns a font to a window upon creation.
        // This call to GetTextMetrics will obtain the information for the default font
        // associated with our window that we created.
        GetTextMetrics(hdc, &textInfo);

        // Now we want to change the color of our default font
        // We can do this by the SetTextColor function.  Notice the macro RGB.  If you
        // are not familiar with color formats, be sure and check out the
        // quick lesson on RGB at the bottom of this file.
        SetTextColor(hdc, RGB(255, 0, 0));


        // Alright, here's where some math comes in :)  It's just simple algebra so don't panic.
        // We want "Hello World!" to be centered in the screen.  So first we want to find the
        // width and height of the window.  Remember we stored the client rect of the window
        // in our WM_CREATE message.  In general a RECT is a struct with four members, left
        // right, top, and bottom.  With (left,top) defining the upper left corner of the
        // RECT and (right,bottom) defining the lower right corner of the RECT.  By definition,
        // a client rect's upper-left corner is (0,0).  This means we know the width and height
        // of the window is clientRect.right and clientRect.bottom respectively.

        // Our goal is to have our text to be centered in the screen.
        // So, first we calculate an (x,y) that are dead center in our window.
        x = clientRect.right / 2;
        y = clientRect.bottom / 2;

        // Now we need to subtract half of the length of the string from
        // our x position so that the string of text can be centered in the
        // window.  To do that, we calculate the number of characters in the string
        // by strlen(szHello).  Next we multiply by the average character width
        // for our font.  This will give us the total length in pixels of our text.
        // Dividing that by two and subtracting it from our x will give us the starting x
        // position to draw our text.
        x = x - ((strlen(szHello) * textInfo.tmAveCharWidth) / 2);

        // Okay x is ready to go, now we need to do a bit more math to y.  We want the
        // text centered in the screen, so we'll subtract off half of the text's height
        // so it's centered nicely in the window.
        y = y - (textInfo.tmHeight / 2);

        // Now we need to print the text, which TextOut will do nicely
        // for us.  The first parameter, hdc, is the device context for
        // drawing to.  The next two parameters, (x,y) is the starting upper-left
        // corner to begin drawing the text to.  The next parameter, szHello, is the
        // the text string to print.  The last parameter, is the number of
        // characters to print.  As mentioned above, strlen() returns the number of
        // characters in a string.
        TextOut(hdc, x, y, szHello, strlen(szHello));

        // And that about wraps up our our end paint.  This should be
        // the last function you call after BeginPaint.  As the name suggests,
        // this tells Windows we're done drawing %)
        EndPaint(hwnd, &paintStruct);
        break;

    // This message is sent when it's time to destroy the window
    case WM_DESTROY:
        PostQuitMessage(0); // Quit the tutorial
        break;
    }

    // The DefWindowProc function calls the default window procedure to provide default processing
    // for any window messages that an application does not process.  This function ensures that every
    // message is processed. DefWindowProc is called with the same parameters received by the WndProc.
    return DefWindowProc (hwnd, iMsg, wParam, lParam);

} // End of the WndProc

// You are probably thinking, "Man, all this for a stupid window and a line of text?"  yes, yes..
// A lot of people don't LIKE windows programming because it can be very large, but then again a
// window is a very complicated thing.  What you will end up doing, once you get familiar with all
// this stuff, is putting most of this into function, so you don't have to continually copy 'n paste it.
// Like, for instance you would create your own CreateWindow() function that you would pass in a width,
// height, maybe a title, and some other parameters.  This function would then do ALL of that stuff for
// you, all in one line.  It is really nice once you get it set up.  You could conceivable do the
// program we just finished, in a few lines, like this:

// #include <windows.h>
//
// CreateMyWindow(100, 100, 400, 400, "My Window!");
//
// while(Messages())
//		DisplayText("Hello World!", TEXT_CENTER);

// There you have it.  If you set up some functions, you could do all of this in 3 lines of code.
// See where I am going with this?  As you get better with the Win32 API you'll be able to
// put together your own base window code to wrap up the Win32 functions.  Matter-of-factly,
// that exactly what Microsoft has done with their MFC and C# windowing languages.  But
// if you want to run as fast as possible, you're going to want to deal directly with the
// Win32 API.

// *Quick Lesson on RGB*:

// RGB stands for Red Green and Blue.  These are the primary colors of life :)
// With these colors, you can make any color.  In the RGB scale, 255 is the max.
// As you see in our program, we used RGB(255, 0, 0); which made our text RED.
// Here is how the macro works:  RGB( Red Intensity, Green Intensity, Blue Intensity);
// If RED is 255 (the max intensity) and GREEN and BLUE are zero, then RED is the final color.
// Here is GREEN:   RGB(0, 255, 0);   Here is BLUE:  RGB(0, 0, 255). Here is RED:  RGB(255, 0, 0);
// Can you guess what RGB(0, 0, 0) is?  What is the absence of color?  Well, what is the absence of light?
// Dark, right... so then the color would be BLACK: RGB(0, 0, 0);  Then what is RGB(255, 255, 255)?
// What color is the highest intensity of light?  It's WHITE: RGB(255, 255, 255);.  Now if you remember
// Messing around with paints when you were in elementary school, if you MIX colors they produce other colors.
// That is the same with the macro RGB().  Here are some mixed colors:
// PINK: RGB(255, 0, 255)	YELLOW: RGB(255, 255, 0)	CYAN (sky blue): RGB(0, 255, 255)
// Now if we want a lower intensity of a color, just decrement the value, say RGB(0, 125, 0) which is a darker green.
// Anyway, I think you get the point.  Just test color combinations to get the desired color, or go buy some paints :)
