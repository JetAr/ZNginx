///////////// *** NEW *** ////////// *** NEW *** ///////////// *** NEW *** ////////////////////

// This tutorial is the first part of a large tutorial series that show you how to
// take many of our win32 tutorials and incorporate all of them to make a simple game.
// We will be using the Map Editor that we created in that tutorial series to create
// the maps for our game.  This game will not be a robust game, but will include most
// of the major features you need to have in order to make a (RPG) game.  For example:
//
// Loading maps, collision detection, player movement, exiting to other maps,
// the ability to interact with characters, inventory system, sound/music, fighting
// monsters, gaining levels/experience, stats, buying and selling from shops, saving
// and loading previously saved games, added party members, simple ai, cinematic cut
// scenes, menus and dialog.
//
// Wow, looking at all of those options make you want to cry!  But don't worry, we will
// go over each one :)  You can wipe away your tears of intimidation and put on some
// sunglasses and sip on a cool lemonade because this tutorial series is gonna be *Hot*!
//
// If you happen to go through our ASCII RPG tutorial series, this series will be
// very similar, except in 2D.  Most of the same code will be the same so you don't
// need to get lost in a bunch more code.  Only a few things were needed to be changed
// in order to make the jump from ASCII to 2D.  Of course, this is because we won't
// be doing any animations in this series.  The story in this tutorial series is
// totally different, so all of the game content is of course changed.
//
// *So what is the game?*
//
// The game is a simple RPG where the character, "Quinn", has a sick brother who
// is given not very much time left to live.  Quinn has a friend named Trendor, who
// gives Quinn an idea to go find a sage who, legend has it, has a potion that could
// help his brother.  Quinn, with nothing to lose, decides to go search for that mage.
// Apparently, the sage lives in a the "new world", which is overrun by monsters and
// no one has entered into that area in many many years.  In fact, there is a guard
// who works 24/7 (which is totally against federal regulations!) to guard the bridge
// that cross over into the new world (I guess he doesn't have a family to go home to,
// poor ... guard... guy).  In order to get past the guard, you need to get permission
// from the governor, who lives near the bridge.  After you try and convince the over
// protective governor to let you cross, he makes you get enough strength first before
// you can convince him that you won't get killed.  So you have to go and kill a bunch
// of creatures to get enough strength for him to say okay (100 strength).  To help you
// out, you can go get Trendor and have him join your party.  This will make killing
// the creatures a ton easier.  Once you get permission from the governor, the guard
// will let you pass and you can find the sage, who will give you a potion.  You can
// then go home and save your brother - game over!
//
// This is a very simple game with no complex or interesting plot, but it should get
// you excited to use your own creativity to make a robust game with a robust plot and
// interesting dialog with the characters :).  The programming techniques in this tutorial
// series don't reflect the best or most efficient/fastest methods, but the simplest methods
// to help someone who wouldn't know how to do these features to be able to get a start
// to do them.  That is the intent of this series, to give you the most basic ways to
// program a game like this.  You then can take it and improve it.
//
// *What does this tutorial include?*
//
// In this tutorial we will be able to move a character around, load maps, exit to other
// maps and ride a pony.  Well, ... we won't be able to ride a pony, but it's just as fun!
// So, just the basic movement of the game, with the collision detection added as well.
// The character starts on the "blcorner.map", which is right outside your house.
//
// Since we are using the maps that we created from the Map Editor it will be easy
// to get us moving around on them.  The work is already done.  I went and created the
// whole world for our game in the editor.  You can find those maps in the Maps\ directory.
// Each map is connected to another map.  The character will be able to walk around the maps
// and when they hit an exit, it will transition to another map (depending on the destination
// map set in the editor).  We have shops, houses, outside wilderness, etc...
//
// *User input for this tutorial*
//
// Arrow Keys - Move the player
// Esc - Quit the game
//
// The base for this code was primarily taken from the Map Editor code, but has been
// changed enough to warrant everything *** NEW *** :)  If you haven't looked at that code then
// you should, since we won't be going over much explanation in this tutorials of topics
// already covered, but will focus more on the game design and theory of how to put the
// game together.
//
// Let's get on with the code!
//
//

//////////// *** NEW *** ////////// *** NEW *** ///////////// *** NEW *** ////////////////////

// To handle our map loading and such, we have a global map object.  We also
// have our player object global as well.  To handle input we created an object
// to control the user's input.  We also store the cursor position for menus later.

// *Quick Notes*
//
// This first file was pretty simple.  Nothing too new was really added,
// but it's important to get a input and drawing setup done correctly
// so that you can specify the game loop and have the basis for your game.
//
// I suggest checking out Player.cpp next to see the player movement and
// draw code.  You can then check out the beefy parts in Map.cpp :)  This
// code is what was formerly called Tile.cpp in the Map Editor.
//
// All we did in this Main.cpp file is create an Init() function to load
// and setup our map and player.  We then created an object to check for
// input from the user (CInput).  Next, we create a function to handle that
// input for the main game loop (movement of the character...), which is
// HandleGameInput().  This isn't all of the input, but the main game
// movement.  We use other functions for menu and shopping input.
//
// We then have our MainLoop() function which has our main game loop.  The
// loop will go until we either quit with ESC, File->Quit, or die, which is
// impossible in this tutorial, since there are no creatures to fight.
//
// We sure to note the new functions we added in Bitmap.cpp for doing
// opaque blits of bitmaps.  This allows us to do see through effects for
// things such as menus.  It gives our project a more professional, sharp look.
//
// In the next tutorial we will focus on the dialog of Npc's and music/sfx.
// We need to also go over menu code in order to do this.
//
// Good luck till then!
