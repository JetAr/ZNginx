	Okay what we're going to do here is a little drawing using an HPEN.  Windows refers
	to all objects that can be used to draw things in a window collectively as GDI
	(Graphic Device Interface) objects.  To us, a HPEN is nothing more than a handle to a pen.
	So all that's really important to know up front is that we can draw stuff by using HPENs.
	But lets dig a bit deeper...

	In Win32 pens are used to draw lines.  So if we wanted to draw a rectangle to the
	screen, using a Win32 API, the border line that defines the rectangle would
	be drawn by whatever style pen is associated with the window.

	Pens are associated	with a device context.  A device context is a pointer that lets us
	talk to hardware devices, such as the graphics card, without knowing anything about the
	hardware device.  In this tutorial we will get the device context of our window and
	associate different pens with it, drawing different rectangles to the screen.

	So without further ado, lets draw.

    // Okay so we have a newly created HPEN.  Yeah!  But now what?  Well we
    // need to tell the device context we want to draw with it about it.  Now when
    // you create a window, you get some things by default.  One of these
    // things is a device context associated with the window.  On top of that,
    // the device context already has a default pen associated with it.  Windows
    // will allow you to color with other pens, but it asks that before you
    // are done playing, you put all the toys back where you found them.  So
    // the next line of code first associares the HPEN with our HDC (remember you
    // can only have ONE pen associated with an HDC at a time).  Next it returns
    // to us the currently selected pen in the HDC (again by default we'll have a
    // pen).  We store that in "oldPen", because when we are done using our pen
    // we need to put back the pen that was already there.
    oldPen = (HPEN)SelectObject(gHDC,hpen);

    // Draw a random rectangle from (0,0) to some a random (x,y) inside of
    // the window
    Rectangle(gHDC, 0, 0, rand()%gRect.right, rand()%gRect.bottom);

    // Okay we've drawn a rectangle, fantastic.  Now we get to be good
    // Windows children and put back all of our toys.

    // First we put back the original pen associated with our HDC
    SelectObject(gHDC,oldPen);

    // Then when we called CreatePen() a pen was dynamically allocated for us.
    // We need to free that memory up.  To do this we call DeleteObject()
    DeleteObject(hpen);

/* Penmanship...

	You will find that there is a common set of commands to use Windows GDI objects.
	It goes something like this:

		1)  Create the object
		2)  Select it into the device context you are using
		3)	Draw things
		4)  When finished, put back the object that was there before

	If you follow those rules, you shouldn't get any ill effects or memory leaks when
	using GDI objects.
