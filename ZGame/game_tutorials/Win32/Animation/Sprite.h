// *Quick Notes*
//
// This needs to be include from now on in your projects if
// you want to use sprites, also sprite.cpp.  This allows you
// to not have to copy and paste functions into your program,
// just include these files in your project.  This is also
// needed for animation if you are including bitmap.cpp/bitmap.h.
