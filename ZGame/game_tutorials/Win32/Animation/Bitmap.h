// *Quick Notes*
//
// This needs to be include from now on in your projects if
// you want to use bitmaps, also bitmap.cpp.  This allows you
// to not have to copy and paste functions into your program,
// just include these files in your project.  This is also
// needed for animation if you are including sprite.cpp/sprite.h.
