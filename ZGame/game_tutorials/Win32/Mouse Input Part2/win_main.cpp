	Here we'll take a second look at obtaining mouse input in your Win32 app.  Specifically
	we'll go over how to check the left mouse button, right mouse button, and mouse wheel
	for input.

	Here's the short list of what our program will do:

	1) While the left mouse button is held down, the text "Left MB" will appear
	   in the center of the screen
	2) While the right mouse button is held down, the text "Right MB" will appear
	   in the center of the screen
	3) Scrolling the mouse wheel will change the color of the text for both the left
	   and right mouse button messages.

	Simple right?  Right!?!  You bet it will be.  So lets get on with the show

// Okay first things first.  We have to cover up a MS boo-boo.  If you read MSDN it says
// that you can program for the mouse wheel as long as you have 98 and up.  Well it turns
// out that this simply isn't true.  Depending on your OS/compiler you may have to
// define the mouse wheel yourself.

/*
	Unfortunately, you have to potentially do something special to get
	the mouse wheel to work (yes you can blame this on MS :)

	So lets look at the code we use for WM_MOUSEWHEEL and what it's doing:

		#ifndef WM_MOUSEWHEEL // This says "Okay if what MS says is supposed to be
							  // defined isn't, lets do something about it"
		#define WM_MOUSEWHEEL 522 // We define the value to what it's suppose to equal
								  // We get this from from Winuser.h
		#endif

    If you wanted to use the WHEEL_DELTA value, you would have to write code similar to what's
	above.  WHEEL_DELTA indicates the distance that the wheel is rotated, expressed
	in multiples or divisions of WHEEL_DELTA, which is 120.  So if you wanted to use WHEEL_DELTA
	set it to 120.

	If you are interested to why this just doesn't work,  open up winuser.h (just search for
	it on your computer) and then inside the file search for WM_MOUSEWHEEL.  You'll see the
	code preventing this from working.  I would HIGLY recommend NOT changing winuser.h.
	Just do the fix as it's done in	this tutorial and all is well :)

	When dealing with messages in the WinProc() of any type, it's important to know
	exactly what they do.  So for an exercise try (for example) pressing and holding the
	left mouse button, moving the cursor completely off the window, and releasing.
	See if you can get the app to show/erase the text NO MATTER where your mouse is.

	*HINT* look up WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN (and others similar) in MSDN
