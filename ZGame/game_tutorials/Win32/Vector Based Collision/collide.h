/*  Okay collide.h and collide.cpp are "the meat and potatoes" of this tutorial.
	This is where will make the decision if collision has happened with the edges of
	the window or not.  If it has we will change the direction of the ball according to
	some laws of physics (angle of refraction equals the angle of incidence)
	BUT we'll be disregarding some other concepts of physics (like gravity and friction)
	so our ball will always maintain the speed it's traveling at.
