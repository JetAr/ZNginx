    // So by adding/subtracting the radius from x and y we correctly calculate the bounding
    // box of the ellipse we want to draw

    // So what is the "+ 0.5f" all about?  Well the int() will cast our result to an integer
    // which always rounds down.  We add the 0.5f so we get an more accurate rounding.
    // To demonstrate this "rounding error" look at the following.

    // int someNumber = int(3.9f); // This will round 3.9 down to 3 even though it's much
    // closer to 4

    // int someNumber = int(3.9f + 0.5f) // Well 3.9f + 0.5 = 4.4f and that rounded down
    // is 4 which is what we want since 4 is closer
    // to 3.9 than 3.
