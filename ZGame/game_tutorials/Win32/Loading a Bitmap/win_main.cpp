  Okay all we're going to do is load a bitmap to the screen.  That is it.
  Now it is important to know the method we're using to load the bitmap to the screen is
  just ONE way we could go about doing it.

  You should use this tutorial to play with loading bitmaps so you get familiar with loading 'em
  Try changing some values -- See what crashes, see what doesn't

  I don't know about you, but it looks like it's a good time to start getting loaded :)

/* Bitmap Patch 1.001

	A Device Context is --

	A structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their attributes, and the graphic
	modes that affect output.  In addition, the device context (DC) refers to a physical output
	device -- its name, device driver, and other attributes.  GDI function call parameters
	contain a handle to a DC to include the attributes of the specified device.  There are four
	types of DC: display (supports drawing operations on a video display terminal),
	printer (supports drawing operations on a printer or plotter),
	memory (supports drawing operations on a bitmap),
	and information (supports retrieval of device data.)

		Well that's what MSDN says -- If that is way to much techno-babble just think of a
		device context as a place in the computer where stuff gets stored to make drawing
		to the screen possible :)


	Also, you'll notice if you resize the screen our image goes away!  This is because we are
	only painting the image to the screen ONCE --

	By making "hdc" and "image_dc" global AND copying the function BitBlt() between
	the BeginPaint() and EndPaint() in WM_PAINT the picture will always show (but it will
	flicker	when you redraw it)

	Finally, notice we don't check to see if MyBitmap.bmp actually gets loaded --
	When you do this yourself it would be a VERY GOOD IDEA to see that indeed the bitmap got
	loaded if it didn't, you can decide what to do then (I usually spit out an error message
	and terminate the program)
