// In Visual Studio 2005 Microsoft added safer versions (denoted by a "_s" suffix) to many
// common C/C++ run time functions.  Currently the ISO Standards Committee for C and C++
// is determining if they are going to add them to the official language set.  Until then,
// this define will remove warnings about using the "unsafe" versions of these functions.
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

#include <windows.h>						// You might as well start using these 3 headers as a standard from now on
#include <stdio.h>							// We must include this file to use certain functions like printf(), etc..
#include <string.h>							// We need to include this when using the function strcmp() (compares a string)

void main()									// The beginning of our program
{
    // This starts the main function
    char szAnswer[128] = {0};				// You've seen these before!  This is declaring a string.
    // If we did not have the [128] at the end it would just be a character.
    // We wouldn't need the [128] if we were just asking 'y' or 'n' questions.
    // But since we want the user to type in more than one character, we put
    // the [<amount of characters>] after the name of the variable.  Once
    // again, a variable is a name that points to a place in memory.  Instead of
    // calling everything 0X034F683C, it's easier to use names we understand :)
    // Like "szAnswer" should tell you that this variable is a string of characters
    // that will be holding an answer.  Code can be cryptic sometimes, but the
    // more readable the better, especially if other people will be reading it.
    // Even if other people aren't reading it, you sometimes have to come back and
    // Look at it yourself, and trust me, you DO forget what you were doing, and if you
    // don't comment your code and use readable variable names, you WILL forget.  It sucks.
    // By the way, this is called commenting code.  using "//" to explain things in the code.
    // Of course you would be insane if you commented as much as I am doing here,
    // but I am trying to be as CLEAR as possible.  ONE more thing about this line is, there is an " = {0}".
    // When you have a string, this is the way of initializing it.  If we didn't, it would look like this:
    // "            "IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII8be"    "    if you printed it out.  (basically 128 characters of junk)
    // This is the address of the variable in memory.

    printf("Do you like programming yet? ");// Pose a questions to answer

    scanf("%s", szAnswer);					// Since we are reading in a string, we must use "%s".  Pass in szAnswer to hold the answer.
    // Below is a tricky statement to look at.
    // strcmp() stands for "string compare".  This function compares 2 strings.
    // If you are just testing to see if the strings are equal, it doesn't matter what order
    // you pass them in.  I usually pass in the variable in this case first.
    // The strcmp() function passed back a "0" (zero) if the strings are identical.
    // When I say passes back, I mean that the function returns a number.
    // This might take a lot of explaining... let's see...
    // The code "strcmp(szAnswer, "yes") == 0" calls the function strcmp()
    // and does some internal stuff to check every character in each string to make sure it's identical.
    // If the check finds that they ARE identical, the function strcmp() returns a 0.
    // This means, that the code is literally replaced and the code now looks like this:
    // "0 == 0"  or, "<what ever number was returned> = 0".  It's almost magically replaced.
    // strcmp() returns a negative or positive number if the strings aren't identical, depending
    // on if the left string is greater or less than the right string passed in.
    // But, in most cases, you only test if it equals 0. So moving on.. you'll notice my use of "(", ")"
    // "( strcmp(szAnswer, "yes") == 0)" .. I put one more set of parenthesis around the
    // "strcmp(szAnswer, "yes") == 0" because we are making a second check in the same "IF" statement.
    // You don't NEED to, but once again, it improves readability.  If you are unfamiliar with how
    // parenthesis work, here is an example:
    // " ( Do everything inside of here first) / (and divide the result by the result of this statement) "
    // Better said:   (5 * 2) / 10 = 1  essentially 10 / 10 is what is comes out to, which equals 1.
    // Like I said, you don't need the parenthesis, because the computer knows order of operations,
    // but it is always more readable to the HUMAN who doesn't.  If ever in doubt, use parenthesis.
    // SO!  anyway, we check to see if the user typed in "yes", all lowercase.
    // Then on the other side of the IF statement we check if the user typed "Yes", with the "Y" uppercase.
    // Using the "||" double OR operator, only one of those need to be true in order for the IF statement
    // to execute the code inside of it.
    if( ( strcmp(szAnswer, "yes") == 0) || ( strcmp(szAnswer, "Yes") == 0) )
    {
        // If the user typed in "yes" or "Yes" , print this:
        printf("Good for you!  It's fun isn't it?\n");
    }
    else									// Else, if the user didn't type in "yes" or "Yes"
    {
        // Print these words of encouragement  :)
        printf("Don't worry, if it seems frustrating now, it will become more clear.\n");
    }

    printf("Do you like programming yet? ");// Let's do the exact process, except in a different way.

    rewind( stdin );						// Because we are using scanf() - which isn't the best function...
    // We need to CLEAR the buffer (a place that holds something) that holds
    // the keyboard data, in other words, don't remember what the user typed in before.
    // This rewind() function does that.  "stdin" stands for "standard input".
    // Standard input - The buffer that holds what the user has typed in using the keyboard.
    scanf("%s", szAnswer);					// Get the answer again.

    // The second way checking input from the user is this way.
    // What this does is check the first character that the user typed in.
    // This way might enable the user to be less formal.  Let me explain...
    // The user can type "yah sure!" or "yup!" or "yah, what ever..."
    // and it would still be interpreted as a yes.  You see?
    // Before you can fully understand how this works, let me explain how strings work.
    // Think of the word "string".  Think of how people use the word...
    // "There was a string of people lined up to get their tickets."
    // Think of it like this, "A string of characters".  A character being a letter.
    // All a string is, is just a bunch of lined up characters right?  Strings are words.
    // Since these strings are lined up, you could almost put them in slots right?
    // Well, that is exactly how the computer handles strings, just slots that hold the letters.
    // Remember, this is called an "Array".  You can have an array of numbers too!
    // Let's take the word "Hello".  In a string, this is set up like this:
    // "H" is the ZERO'th slot, "e" is the FIRST slot, "l" is the SECOND slot, "l" is the THIRD slot, and "o" is the FOUTH.
    // Yes, the slot starts at zero... this can be TREMENDOUSLY confusing.
    // BUT! We are forgetting one last slot. . .  ALL strings have a final slot
    // which is  '\0'.  This is called a NULL terminator.  That is why they say, a NULL terminated string.
    // This thing lets the compiler know the string's end.  Let's try and explain it a bit more.
    // We create a string of 128 characters right?  At the beginning?  SO!
    // If you want to print out something to the screen, say what someone typed in...
    // If we didn't have a NULL terminator at the end of the string, it would look like this:
    // (Say you entered "yes") "Your answer was yes                      ."
    // Do you see what I mean?  How would it know to stop?
    // We want it to look like this: "Your answer was yes."  We don't want the extra baggage :)\
    // By the way, I chose [128] for the amount of characters because it just seems like a decent number.
    // Just in case you want to type something more than "yes" or "no"...  realistically we
    // would only need like [4]. or maybe even 2 if we are just checking the first character they type in.
    if( szAnswer[0] == 'y' || szAnswer[0] == 'Y' )
    {
        // If they typed a 'y' or 'Y' first.. print the message
        printf("Good for you!  It's fun isn't it?\n");
    }
    else									// Else if they didn't type a y or Y first..
    {
        // Encourage them :)
        printf("Don't worry, if it seems frustrating now, it will become more clear.\n");
    }
    // FURTHER EXPLANATION:  Here is what's happening if they typed in "yes":
    // szAnswer[0] == 'y' , szAnswer[1] == 'e', szAnswer[2] == 's'
    // The zero slot is 'y', the 1 slot is 'e', the 2 slot is 's'.
    // Remember the slots start at zero, so all we have to do if check if the zero slot equals a 'y' or 'Y'.
    // If this doesn't make sense to you, think of any word and map it out.  Figure out what letter goes in what slot.

    // BTW, this is the notation to access an array;
    // "		<variableName>[index]  i.e.  szName[4] == '\0'  if szName is "Ben"   "
    // You CANNOT! do a check like this:  if(szName == "Ben").  This doesn't work.
    // If szName is an array, that is the same thing as saying if(szName[0] == "Ben")
    // A regular variable is a one dimensional array, so it's default is <name>[0].
    // num[0] = 2;  is the same thing as num = 2;
    // you just don't need to use the [0] because it's understood that's what you meant.
    // Yes, this can be very confusing, but like ANY language you learn, there are things like this.  Take Japanese :)
