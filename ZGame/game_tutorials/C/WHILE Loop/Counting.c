// In this tutorial we will show how to do "loop".  A loop is something that
// "loops" and does something until we tell it to stop.  In this case we do
// a "while loop".  A while loop has a logical TRUE/FALSE statement that it
// checks each iteration of the loop to see if it evaluates to true or false.
// If the statement given to a while loop is true, it continues, otherwise
// it stops looping.  In this tutorial we have the user input a min and
// max value to print all the numbers inbetween to the screen.  In our while
// statement we say we want to loop "while min is less than or equal to max".
// Every loop we print out the min value, and then increment it by one, so
// eventually min will be greater than the max value.  Check out below how we
// do this.


// In Visual Studio 2005 Microsoft added safer versions (denoted by a "_s" suffix) to many
// common C/C++ run time functions.  Currently the ISO Standards Committee for C and C++
// is determining if they are going to add them to the official language set.  Until then,
// this define will remove warnings about using the "unsafe" versions of these functions.
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

#include <stdio.h>

void main()									// The beginning of our program
{
    int min=0, max=0; 					    // We initialize 2 integers (number) variables to store
    // our range.  We set them equal to zero or else they
    // Will be some crazy number like -858993460.  We could
    // Also have said:
    //					int min=0;
    //					int max=0;
    // They are the same thing, it is just cleaner the other way.

    // Now we prompt the user to input a number for the min:
    printf("Input your first number to count from: ");
    // Then we wait until they press <enter> and read what
    // they typed in , then storing it in the variable "min".
    // We use "%d" because that means we are reading in an integer (number).
    scanf("%d", &min);						// See the "&" ?  That means we are putting what ever is typed in, at the memory address of the variable.
    // Here is how this works, it is kinda confusing.  When a variable is allocated,
    // and when I say allocated, we tell Windows that we will need a certain amount of memory from the system.
    // When Windows responds, it gives us a memory location to store the info for that variable.
    // We always want to use the least amount of memory.  For small programs like this it isn't important,
    // but when you get into HUGE projects, it is of UTMOST importance.  It goes fast.  Trust me.
    // So, generally we only want to use the LEAST amount of variables as possible to conserve memory.
    // This is where you start to determine a good programmer:  The fastest and most efficient way.
    // We all struggle with this at some time.  There is always a better way.
    // Now we prompt the user to input a number for the max:
    printf("Input your last number to count to: ");
    // We then read in the highest number
    scanf("%d", &max);
    // Now here comes the while loop:
    // This is called a "While Loop".  You will use these a tremendous amount.
    // A "While Loop" is very similar to a for loop, except there is less going on.
    // " while ( this is true ) do what ever is inside my brackets { }".
    // That is what the while loop is doing.  So in this case,
    // "while ( min is less than or equal to max ) { print out the value of min , then add 1 to min }
    // Let's say we chose 5 for min and 10 for max.
    // "while ( 5 is less than or equal to 10 ) etc....
    // This will print out 5, then 6, then 7, then 8, then 9, then 10 (it will print 10 because 10 is less than or equal to 10 )
    // Then when min becomes 11, 11 isn't <= to 10, so it stops and doesn't do
    // what's in the brackets, it skips them.  No more looping
    while(min <= max)
    {
        // Do what's inside these brackets until the expression is FALSE ( when min is > than max).
        printf("%d\n", min);				// We use %d again because we are printing out a number.  min is our number.  ("\n" goes to the next line)
        min++;								// Increment min by 1.  (remember, this is the same thing as :  "min = min + 1" , just shorter.
    }										// Do what's inside these brackets until the expression is FALSE ( when min is > than max).
    // You might be asking why you would use a "For Loop" verses a "While Loop"?
    // Well, in a for loop, you specify a variable to use as the counter, then a condition for the loop, then a increment value....
    // Where as , what if you don't WANT to specify all of that stuff, like what we did here
    // We could also do something like:  (remember that any text behind "//" is ignored by the compiler.
//   "while(max)				"           // This says, "while ( max does not equal 0) { print the value of max, decrement 1 from max } "
//   "{							"
//	 "    printf("%d\n", max);  "			// This essentially prints the value of "max" down to zero.
//	 "	  max--;				"
//	 "}							"
    // The point being that we don't always need the whole structure of a "For Loop".  We could do the
    // exact same thing with a for loop, however.  In general, while loops are used when something needs to be
    // repeated while a condition is true.  For loops are used when you want to loop for a specific
    // amount of times.
}											// We end "main()" ending our program

// We just completed our first while loop.  Pretending we typed in 10 and 15, here is the output:

// Input your first number to count from: <we type in 10 and press ENTER>
// Input your last number to count to:	  <we type in 15 and press ENTER>
// 10
// 11
// 12
// 13
// 14
// 15
// Press any key to continue				// Windows' way of saying "Get out of my program!" :)

// To compile and run this program assuming you are using Visual C, type CONTROL-F5.
