//**********************************************************************************//


// This tutorial shows you how to use console functions to create an ASCII character
// on the screen and move it around with the arrow keys on the keyboard.  This is where
// programming gets a little more excited.  Once you get this tutorial understood you
// can start to program some fun things.  Check our Maze tutorial for more on this.


#include "MoveMan.h"								// Here we include our header file that includes all the other headers, functions and structures.

HANDLE hInput, hOutput;								// We create some HANDLES for input and output.  We don't put them in main() because we
// want them to be GLOBAL.  That means ALL of the functions can use them, not just inside of main.

CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO ScrInfo;					// We declare our Screen Information structure.  We'll fill this with all the screen info for our
// console window.  We want this GLOBAL so all of our functions can utilize it.

void DrawPlayer(PLAYER Player, int Draw)			// Here we define what our function does
{
    if(Draw)										// We Draw == DRAW (the #define DRAW 1)
    {
        // Set the cursor position according to the player's position.
        SetConsoleCursorPosition(hOutput, Player.Position);
        printf("@");								// Print the '@' (at symbol) to the screen at the cursor's position.
    }
    else											// If "Draw" == ERASE, then we want to erase the character.
    {
        // We want to draw over the character with a ' ' (space), so we set the cursor to the player's position.
        SetConsoleCursorPosition(hOutput, Player.Position);
        printf(" ");								// Now when we print a ' ', it will draw OVER the last '@' (at symbol).
        // If we didn't erase the player, it would look like he is multiplying and would leave a trail where he had been.
    }
}

void MovePlayer(PLAYER *Player)						// This is where we create our function MovePlayer().
{
    // Notice that we put these variable inside of the function, because no one else uses them besides this function.
    INPUT_RECORD InputRecord;						// Here is our structure to hold the information on the input buffer (what the user does).
    DWORD Events=0;									// We create DWORD to be compatible with ReadConsoleInput().  (Holds how many input events took place).

    // Read in the input from the user, storing the information into the InputRecord structure.
    ReadConsoleInput(hInput, &InputRecord, 1, &Events);
    // Here we use the "EventType" variable.  This variable holds if it was a MOUSE or KEYBOARD Event.	Meaning, did we use the mouse or keyboard?
    if(InputRecord.EventType == MOUSE_EVENT)		// MOUSE_EVENT is defined somewhere in windows.h.  We are checking if we touched the mouse...
    {
        // If we did use the mouse, check if we pressed the left mouse button.  FROM_LEFT_1ST_BUTTON_PRESSED is also defined somewhere in windows.h.
        // If you remember in the last tutorial we used "...Event.KeyEvent...." Now we are checking the mouse information.
        // Inside the "MouseEvent" structure we have variables that hold the button pressed, mouse position, and if the CONTROL key is pressed down.
        // There is one more not worth mentioning... Here we are checking if the Left mouse button is pressed.
        if(InputRecord.Event.MouseEvent.dwButtonState == FROM_LEFT_1ST_BUTTON_PRESSED)
        {
            DrawPlayer(*Player, ERASE);				// Here we call our DrawPlayer() function, but pass in ERASE.
            // We want to erase the OLD character before draw the new character.
            // You notice we put the '*' in front of "Player".  This is called dereferencing.
            // Because we passed the "memory address" of "Player", "Player" is now considered a "pointer".
            // If you look at the DrawPlayer() function: DrawPlayer(PLAYER Player, int Draw);
            // DrawPlayer() doesn't ask for the address of "Player" (PLAYER Player).  It just needs it's information, not it's address.
            // So, to make the compiler happy, we put a '*' in front of the pointer to de-reference it, and just pass in it's information.

            // If we clicked the left Mouse Button, put the Player where ever the mouse was clicked.
            // More pointer notation :)  See the '->' (arrow) pointing to "Position.X"?
            // When you have a pointer of a structure, which "Player" is.... and you want to access it's variables,
            // You must use a '->' instead of a '.'.  This is only for the pointer.  You notice that you don't need to for the "Position".
            // "Position" ISNT a pointer, "Player" is the pointer.  This can be tricky.  But when you use pointers more, it will all become clear.
            // We are setting the players position to where ever the mouse clicked... The position of where the mouse clicked
            // Is stored in The InputRecord.Event.MouseEvent.dwMousePosition.
            // dwMousePosition is a COORD.  So to get it's X value we put a ".X" after dwMousePosition.  Same for the Y value.

            Player->Position.Y = InputRecord.Event.MouseEvent.dwMousePosition.Y;

        }
    }

    // Below we do a check to make sure if a key was pressed, and only pressed down.
    // To make sure it was just a down press, and not an up press, we check ...bKeyDown.
    // For Windows 95 and 98, we don't need this, but for NT/XP based systems, it handles
    // the console functions different.  In Windows 95 and 98, it only registers a key
    // when the key is pressed down, where NT OS's register the key up and key down.
    // This makes the player go 2 moves every time, so we need to make sure we just
    // move the player when the key is DOWN.  We use the bKeyDown variable stored in the
    // input record, then just make sure it equals "true" when a key is hit.

    // Now we check if there was a keyboard event.
    if(InputRecord.EventType == KEY_EVENT && InputRecord.Event.KeyEvent.bKeyDown)

    hOutput = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);		// what type of handle we want.  We do the same for the output handle.

    // We set the console mode to enable CONTROL-C and MOUSE_INPUT.  Now we can use the mouse.
    // You'll notice the "|" OR operator.  This combines 2 numbers together, not addition, but their bits.
    // This is a binary operation that sets 0 bits to 1.  Quick lesson in binary (If you are curious):
    // Here is the number 8 in binary:  "1000"
    // Here is the number 2 in binary:  "0010"
    // Do you see how I got those numbers?  The numbers read from right to left.
    // 0 = "0000" 1 = "0001" 2 = "0010" 4 = "0100" and 8 = "1000"
    // Each to the left is the number to the right times 2 essentially. So... if we add 2 "0010" + 1 "0001" = "0011" -> we get 3.
    // So... what an OR "|" does.. is .. well let me just show you...
    //						"8:  "1000"
    //			OR'd with   "2:  "0010"
    //			becomes		"10: "1010"
    // So 8 OR'd with 2 becomes 10 because it combines the bits together if the same slots have a 1 and a 0.
    //						8: "1000"
    //			 OR'd with	8: "1000"
    //					=	8: "1000:
    // So 8 OR'd with 8 becomes 8 because they both have "1" in that first slot.  Anyway.. . We have a tutorial
    // on binary operators, but basically it compares the 2 numbers and sets the bits of the other number in the same slot to 1 if they are zero.
    // Don't stress it, I didn't get it for a LONG time.  It just takes some paper and a good friend to help :)
    // To close this concept up, for now accept that it allows you to input 2 options.  What the function does is
    // takes a MASK which checks which bits (bits meaning slots containing a 1 or a 0) are set to 1.

    Player.Position.Y = SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2;			// So we divide the width and height by 2 right?

    // Here we call this function to set the cursor position.  The position comes from our player structure.

    }

    // Doesn't our game loop look pretty now? :)  Just one function call.
    // This is what a game loop should look like.  Just function calls.  Maybe an "if" or so, but
    // The idea is to keep it simple.  We just want to create functions that control and run the game,
    // and then call those function inside the game loop.
    // Layer, you will see a "while(GameIsRunning)" ..
    // The "GameIsRunning" flag would be set to 1 (or TRUE) first, then if the user hits VK_ESCAPE (the escape key) "GameIsRunning"
    // will be set to 0 (or FALSE), causing the "while(GameIsRunning)" loop to quit and the game is over.  For a list of
    // all the Virtual Key Codes like "VK_etc", you can go to: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/winui/vkeys_529f.htm
    // That is also where you can search for HELP on programming and syntax.
    // For now we will just let CONTROL-C quit.

// Now I am sure you understand how to use structures, and if you don't... you will never make it!
// Just kidding!  Like everything, practice makes perfect.  It's like learning ANY language, you need to
// constantly be around it and more importantly USE it.
//
// * Cautions *
//
// You should keep in mind that the mouse code will NOT work on some operating systems, such as
// Windows 2000 until you turn off QuickEdit and Insert Mode for that window.  To do this, you will
// want to run the program, then click in the upper left hand corner of the window.  A menu will come
// up, now go to properties.  Make sure you have the "Options" tab selected and look in the "Edit Options"
// area.  Then, uncheck "QuickEdit" and "Insert Mode".  That way it won't try and think you are wanting
// to copy some text from the window.  Next, choose the save button and make sure it saves it for
// all window titles with the same name.  Then close the program and open it up again. It should work then.
