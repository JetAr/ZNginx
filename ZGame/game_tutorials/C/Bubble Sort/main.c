	The Bubble Sort is just one of many methods out there to "sort lists of data".  It is
	certainly NOT the fastest method, but it's pretty simple to implement and if you don't need
	a blazing fast sort routine, it will get the job done.

	The Bubble Sort works like this:

		1)  First you have to have some "list of data" (let's say an array of integers).
		2)  Next you need to decide if you want the data arranged least to greatest (A - Z)
			or greatest to least (Z - A).  Let's suppose we go with "least to greatest".
		3)  Next, you start with the FIRST element and you loop until you get to the
			end of the array.
		4)  Inside of this loop, you have another loop that also starts at the beginning of
			the array.  You check the element from the outer loop against the element in
			the inner loop.  If the inner loop element is GREATER then the outer loop element,
			you swap the two elements (swap the value stored at those specific array indexes).
		4)  Then you keep repeating until done (yes I know very wordy :)

	We're going to go ahead an implement the bubble sort function --
	It will take an array of integers, the count of integers you want to sort (usually
	this would be the whole array) and a flag specifying to sort from "least to greatest" or
	"greatest to least".

	So with that, let's get rolling...
