//***********************************************************************//


// This tutorial shows you how to use "if statements" and "else statements"
// to control what happens in your program.  In this example, we have the user
// input their age, and then depending on how old they are, we print out a
// specialized message.  You will use if and else statements in pretty much
// every program you will ever create, especially if you allow the user to
// do things and interact with your program.  Look below to see how we use them.


// In Visual Studio 2005 Microsoft added safer versions (denoted by a "_s" suffix) to many
// common C/C++ run time functions.  Currently the ISO Standards Committee for C and C++
// is determining if they are going to add them to the official language set.  Until then,
// this define will remove warnings about using the "unsafe" versions of these functions.
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

#include <stdio.h>							// We must include this file to use certain functions

void main()									// The beginning of our program
{
    // This starts the main function
    int age=0;								// Initialize a integer variable for the age

    printf("How old are you? ");			// Print to the screen a questions about the users age.

    scanf("%d", &age);						// Read in the answer after the user hits return.
    // You'll notice the "&" symbol right before the variable.
    // Here comes a confusing part for everyone when starting to program.
    // scanf() is a function that takes 2 parameters.  The first is the format
    // that the user is typing in... either that be a number, a decimal number, or a string,
    // or a single character.  Now, the next parameter is the variable to HOLD whatever the user
    // Types in.  Ok, here comes the confusing part..
    // If you pass a variable into a function, and the function CHANGES the variable in any way,
    // when the function is finished, the variable will NOT change unless the function has
    // the address in memory to the variable.  You give the function the address in memory by
    // putting the "&" symbol in front.  If you didn't, the program would crash after you typed in an age.
    // This is a HUGE subject that will be discussed later, and more fully.
    // Essentially, when anything is passed into a function, you could think of it as the
    // function making it's own local copy.  If you want the function to change what ever you passed in,
    // You have to use &.  If that doesn't make any sense.. don't sweat it.  I will explain it all
    // later when we start using functions and pointers.


    // NOW!  Get ready for IF and ELSE statements! Muhahaha!
    if(age > 20)							// This is an IF statement.  This is simply saying:
    {
        // "  If age is greater than 20 "
        printf("You're over 20 huh?\n");	// Print this message
    }										// End the if statement


    if(age > 30)							// This checks if the age entered was over 30
        printf("You're over 30!?\n");		// Print this message

    // Now you might have noticed that there was no "{" "}" brackets.
    // Well, you don't HAVE to use brackets if there is only one line
    // after the condition, either it be a while, a for, or an if/else....
    // The fact is that it's also a good habit to get into and makes your
    // Code more readable (which is good!)  You also tend to find yourself
    // adding things inside your statements (for, while, if) so you might as well
    // Just put it there for the future; just a coding preference I guess.

    // If the user typed 35 as their age, the program would print out both messages above.
    // But if they entered something like 25, it would only print the first one.

    if(age < 20)  							// Here is another coding style...  people who put their "{" after the conditional statement.
    {
        printf("You're a young'n!\n");		// This doesn't do anything different, it's just that some people prefer it.
    }										// I've programed for a language that REQUIRES it, but C/C++ is VERY flexible where there are
    // very few REQUIRED syntax.  Actually, you could even do this and it would work:
    // "	if(age < 20) printf("You're a young'n!\n"); "
    // You don't even need a new line OR brackets (if it's only one line after).
    // This is why ";" semicolons are important.  It let's the compiler know to
    // go on to the next statement.  you can do things like this:
    // "	age++; age--; age = age; "
    // This adds 1 to age, subtracts one to age, then assigns age to age...
    // Which does absolutely nothing, but you see my point, you don't need to skip a line, just use semicolons.
    // It all boils down to readable code.  That is what is important.

    if(age < 20 && age > 12)				// Here is something new.  The "&&" means "and".
    {
        // So the statement is saying, "if ( age is less than 20 AND greater than 12) "
        printf("Being in your teens can tough...\n");
    }										// Printf out the message
    // You will use this type of expression a lot.  There is also :
    // "!=" -> does not equal    and    "||" -> or
    // So instead of checking if both things are true, you can check if one or the other are true
    // by using "||", the OR operator.
    // If you are familiar with the binary operators, "&", and "|" ....
    // These are similar, but different.  "&&" and "||" check conditions between 2 statements.
    // if the user is a teenager, the message would have printed to the screen.

    if(age == 100)							// This checks if "age equals 100".  This is different from "age = 100".
        printf("WOW!  What's your secret!?\n");
    // "age == 100" checks to see if the value of age is 100, while "age = 100" assigns the value 100 to the variable age.

    if(age > 50)							// Here is another usage of IF statements.
        printf("Life after 50 can be great!\n");
    else									// If age isn't greater than 50, print the other message below.
        printf("You've still got a LONG way to go...\n");

    // This is what we call IF/ELSE statements.
    // "	if( <The statement here is true> )	  "
    // "		<do this>						  "
    // "	else								  "
    // "		<do this instead>                 "

    // You might be wondering by now about the spacing after conditional statements.
    // It all falls back to code readability.  It's not fun to look at un-formatted code.
    // If you ever want to people to help you (which you WILL!) you have to comment and
    // indent your code, or else they won't even try.
    // Remember, you CAN and probably should use { } 's.

    //		if (etc)
    //		{
    //			<do this>
    //		}
    //		else
    //		{
    //			<do this>
    //		}

    // It's so much easier to understand.  Even if you only have one line after each.

}											// This ends the main function (program is done)
