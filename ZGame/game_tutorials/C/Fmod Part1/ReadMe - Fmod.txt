//***********************************************************************

Files:  	main.c     (The Source File containing the actual code)
		fmod.h     (The Header File holding the function and structure prototypes)
		Fmod.vcxproj  (The VC++ Project File holding the project info)
		Fmod.sln  (The Solution File holding the solution info)
		techno.mod (The MOD file which holds the song data)

Libraries:	fmod.dll   (The Dynamic Link Library needed in order to run the program)
		fmodvc.lib (The Fmod Library needed to compile the program)
	
Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (version 7.0) just click on the
		<Program Name>.vcxproj file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.c.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .c extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it
 will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		a console window should pop up with the program. :)
