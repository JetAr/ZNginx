// This is a compiler directive that includes libraries (For Visual Studio).
// You can manually include the libraries in the "Project->settings" menu under
// the "Link" tab.  You need this library to compile this program.
#pragma comment(lib, "fmodvc.lib")

#include <stdio.h>							// Here we include the standard include file
#include <stdlib.h>							// This is included so we can use exit()
#include <conio.h>							// This is used so we can use _kbhit() and getch()
#include "fmod.h"							// This is the fmod header file that we need to use fmod

// What is Fmod?  What let's see what www.fmod.org says about it:

// "FMOD is the fastest, most powerful and easiest to use sound system on Windows
// and Linux and WinCE there is. Supporting 3d sound, midi, mods, mp3, ogg vorbis,
// wma, recording, geometry processing, cd playback, mmx, internet streaming,
// dsp effects, spectrum analysis, user created samples and streams, synchronization
// support, DMO FX, EAX 1&2, A3D 3.0, C/C++/VB/Delphi/MASM and MORE you cant go wrong!"

// Isn't that amazing??  And it's free!  Basically, what we at GameTutorials.com would
// use it for is DEMOS DEMOS DEMOS and GAMES GAMES GAMES!  The DarkSide demo uses this
// for it's music.  I thought it would be a good idea to get a GameTutorials.com demo
// so you could see the simplest way to play a song. *Note* - This tutorial only plays
// MOD and MIDI formats.  Other function calls are necessary for the other formats.

// This is the song name that we are going to load.  It doesn't need to have
// .mod as the extension, but it seemed fitting.
#define SONG_NAME "techno.mod"

int main()									// Beginning of our program
{
    FMUSIC_MODULE *pModule;

    // ==========================================================================================
    // CHECK DLL VERSION
    // ==========================================================================================

    // First we want to make sure the DLL that we are using is the correct one we need.
    // Below we check if the one we are using is less than the one we need.

    // Make sure we are using the correct DLL version
    if (FSOUND_GetVersion() < FMOD_VERSION)
    {
        // Display the error message that shows we need the correct version
        printf("Error : You are using the wrong DLL version!  You should be using FMOD %.02f\n", FMOD_VERSION);

        // Quit the program
        exit(1);
    }

    // ==========================================================================================
    // INIT SOUND SYSTEM
    // ==========================================================================================

    // Now that we know we have the right DLL, we need to initialize the FMod Sound System.
    // We want our mix rate to be to be 44100mhz (Good CD Quality), and we pass in 32 for
    // the max software channels, then FSOUND_INIT_GLOBALFOCUS to show we want it to play
    // no matter what window is in focus.

    // Initialize our FMod Sound System with good quality sound and a global focus
    if (!FSOUND_Init(44100, 32, FSOUND_INIT_GLOBALFOCUS))
    {
        // If we couldn't initialize the sound system we print out the error
        printf("%s\n", FMOD_ErrorString(FSOUND_GetError()));

        // Quit the program
        exit(1);
    }

    // ==========================================================================================
    // LOAD SONG
    // ==========================================================================================

    // Everything should be up and running with the sound system, so let's load a song.
    // To load a song we just pass in the file name to FMUSIC_LoadSong().
    // This returns a FMUSIC_MODULE pointer.  We use this pointer to query and play the song.

    // Load the desired song and store the pointer to that module.
    pModule = FMUSIC_LoadSong(SONG_NAME);

    // Make sure we got a valid module pointer
    if (!pModule)
    {
        // Print the error message to the screen
        printf("%s\n", FMOD_ErrorString(FSOUND_GetError()));

        // Quit the program
        exit(1);
    }

    // ==========================================================================================
    // PLAY SONG
    // ==========================================================================================

    // We should have a pointer to a module that will allow us to play the song.
    // All we need to do is pass in the module to FMUSIC_PlaySong().

    // Play our song that we loaded
    FMUSIC_PlaySong(pModule);

    // Here we post a message that tells how to quit the program
    printf("Press any key to quit\n");
    printf("=========================================================================\n");

    // The song should be playing right now, so we can start querying information about it.
    // Let's get the name of the song first.  We do this by passing in the pointer pModule
    // to FMUSIC_GetName().  This will return the name as a char string.

    // Display the name of the file being played
    printf("Playing %s...\n", FMUSIC_GetName(pModule));

    // Now that the song is playing, we want to get some information about it.
    // Below we print out the order, the row, the amount of channels being played and
    // the CPU usage.  Let me explain a bit about these.  First off, the order can be
    // associated with a measure of a midi file.  So think of order as the measure.
    // What is a measure?  If you have ever looked at sheet music you will see vertical
    // lines going across the horizontal lines, but spaced somewhat far apart.  Inside
    // each measure there are notes.  The amount of notes depend on the measure count.
    // Say, a 4/4 measure would have 4 beats per measure, so 4 quarter notes.  So,
    // moving on, the next one is a row.  Think of a row as the beats, or notes...
    // Some songs have 127 (like this one) rows per order and some have 63, and some
    // have others.  You can use this information for doing cool effects, like... if
    // the order is 4 and the row is 120, you could make your cube spin the opposite way.
    // It makes for cool demo's, like on the DarkSide demo on the internet.
    // The channels that are playing are the amount of instruments being used in the song
    // currently.  Some songs use a lot, some songs might use 4 or 5.  If you are playing
    // a MIDI song verses a MOD song it will not display the order and row.  Finally, the
    // CPU Usage is quite obvious... what percent of the CPU is being used by the song.

    // Loop until we hit the keyboard
    while (!_kbhit())
    {
        // Print out the details of the current song being played.
        // Notice the "\r", it will redraw over itself each time.
        printf("order: %d, row: %d channels playing: %d cpu usage: %.02f%%     \r",
               FMUSIC_GetOrder(pModule),		// This returns the order the mod is on
               FMUSIC_GetRow(pModule),			// This returns the current row of the order
               FSOUND_GetChannelsPlaying(),	// This returns the amount of channels being played
               FSOUND_GetCPUUsage());			// This returns the CPU usage for this song
    }

    // We get here if we hit a key on the keyboard, so that must mean we are done.
    // Now we need to do the clean up.  We just call FMUSIC_FreeSong() and FSOUND_Close().

    // Wait for a key to be pressed before we quit
    _getch();

    // Go the the next line
    printf("\n");

    // Free the current module
    FMUSIC_FreeSong(pModule);

    // Close and turn off the FMOD Sound System.
    FSOUND_Close();

    // Return a success!
    return 0;

//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load most types of MOD or MIDI files.  This is was
// an exciting tutorial to write because it does so much for you!  The Fmod library
// is perfect for games and demos.
//
// * What Can I Play With This? * (MIDI, MOD)
//
// You can play most, if not all MOD formats like .mod, .s3m, .xm, etc....  The file
// extension isn't important because the FMod library checks the actual file type.
// You can call it what ever you want.  This also plays MIDI files.  You don't need
// any new code, just change the file name to a MIDI and it will work!  Cool huh?!!?
//
// Once again, using mods for demos is cool because you can check the position in the
// song, then trigger a cool effect depending where it is.  For instance, you could
// say, if the order is 8 and the row is 36, Scale the screen, or start moving in.
// There is so much that can be done with the FMod Sound System, but I have no idea
// how to do it all.  Check out our MP3 tutorial as well.
//
// * Files Included *
//
// The files included are necessary for compiling and running the application.
// You do not need the FMODVC.LIB or FMOD.H to run it of course, but to compile
// it you will.  You will ABSOLUTELY need FMOD.DLL to run the application.
// For those of you who haven't worked with DLL's before, a DLL is a Dynamic
// Linked Library that access functions on the fly, in run time.  VB uses them
// for their applications.  It is different than a static link library (.lib)
// because the .LIB's code is compiled into the .EXE.  DLL's are great if you
// have multiple applications uses the same code and don't want to bloat your
// files.  You can either stick the DLL in your system directory or in the same
// directory as the application being run.  Once again, the DLL is a MUST have
// to run your application.  I might add also, that the fmod.h isn't the standard
// fmod.h that you get with the downloadable zip from www.fmod.org.  I added
// the fmod_errors.h file to the end of it because it was a small amount of code
// to leave in a header file.  It's better to just have 1 header file in this case.
//
// I love this library and I hope you will too!!  Let us know what you do with it.
//
// I would like to thank the team at www.Fmod.org for the library and also the sample
// source code.  The code in this tutorial was primarily from the sample distributed
// in the FMod library.
