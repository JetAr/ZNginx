	All right, what this tutorial is going to focus on is "pointers to pointers", also
	called "double pointers".  Double pointers are really not too difficult of a concept,
	but the code can look intimidating.

	A pointer remember, is nothing more than "a variable which represents a specific address
	in memory".  So a double pointer would be "a variable which represents a specific address
	in memory that represents another address in memory".

	Of course this chain of "pointers" can continue.  You could have "a pointer to a
	pointer to a pointer" if you wanted, but for the most part "double pointers" is as
	"complex" as it gets :)

	To demonstrate a use of pointers to pointers, we're going to make a 2-Dimensional array
	at runtime.  This program will prompt you for the dimensions, create the 2D array, fill
	it with numbers, and print it to the screen.

#include <stdio.h> // So we can use printf(), scanf()
#include <stdlib.h> // Defines EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS

int main()
{
    // We're creating a 2D array that is going to represent a "Matrix",
    // so the first thing to do is ask how many rows and how many columns are going to
    // be in the matrix.
    int row = 0; // Number of rows
    int col = 0; // Number of columns

    int i, j; // "Counter variables" for our for loops

    int **matrix = NULL; // The variable that will hold our matrix (pointer to a pointer)

    // Get the number of rows
    printf("Enter the number of rows (at least one, less than 10) for the matrix: ");
    scanf("%d",&row);

    // Bounds check the number of rows
    if((row <= 0) || (row >= 10))
    {
        printf("You don't follow instructions to well\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Get the number of columns
    printf("Enter the number of columns (at least one, less than 10) for the matrix: ");
    scanf("%d",&col);

    {
        printf("You don't follow instructions to well\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Let's create the "matrix":
    // First what we do is create memory for "row" number of "int*" (a chunk of memory
    // that points to chunks of memory capable of holding ints).
    matrix = (int**)malloc(sizeof(int*) * row);

    // Now, for all the "chunks of memory capable of holding ints" we're going to
    // allocate space for an array on ints "col" large.
    for(i = 0; i < row; i++)
        matrix[i] = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * col);

    // What we have is a "row by col" array of ints.

    // Now we're going to walk this matrix (accessing it just as if we would of
    // created in like this: int matrix[row][col];), then fill it with numbers from
    // 0 to (col - 1).
    for(i = 0; i < row; i++)
        for(j = 0; j < col; j++)
            matrix[i][j] = j;

    // Now print out the contents of the matrix to the screen (so it looks something
    // like a matrix).
    for(i = 0; i < row; i++)
    {
        printf("\n");

        for(j = 0; j < col; j++)
            printf("%d",matrix[i][j]);
    }

    // Extra line for good looks :)
    printf("\n");


    // Now we must free the matrix.  First we're free all the "col" number of
    // "integer (int) arrays" we allocated.  Notice how we loop for "row" times
    // because we made "row" number of "col" sized int arrays.
    for(i = 0; i < row; i++)
        free(matrix[i]);

    // Then we'll free the "array of int*" (array of int arrays) we allocated
    free(matrix);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS; // It was a good little program
}
