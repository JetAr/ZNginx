	So what exactly is a for loop?  Well, a for loop is nothing more than a way to tell
	the computer to do something for a specific number of times.  For loops are great for
	doing something in a program "count" number of times.

    So let's say you wanted to print out "Hello World" 10 times.  Well you could do the
	following:

	int main()
	{
		// Display to the screen the text "Hello World" -- Then carriage return to the
		// next line down (that's what the \n does).

		printf("Hello World\n");
	    printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");
		printf("Hello World\n");

		return 0;
	}

	But what if you wanted to print it 100 times???  That would be a lot of "copy 'n pasting".
	This is but one example of where a for loop would come in handy.

	So let's get on with the show :)

// First we include this file "stdio.h".  This is a "header file" that includes a bunch
// of "function definitions" that some smart people wrote for us to use in our
// programs.  For the time being, just KNOW that you need to include the following
// "header file" to be able to print to the screen.

#include <stdio.h> // So we can use printf()

/*
   This is the main function (the core of ALL "console" programs).  Here we are going
   to return an int (integer) from it.  The rule is, if your program encounters an error
   you should return the integer 1, otherwise you should return the integer 0 to signify
   that everything went great!
*/
int main()
{
    // So what we want to do is print to the screen "Hello World" 10 times using a for loop.

    int count; // This is an "integer" variable.  It will be used to count from 0 to 10 in
    // our for loop.

    // Below is the code that prints "Hello World" 10 times to the screen
    for(count = 0; count < 10; count++)
    {
        printf("Hello World\n");
    }

    /* Okay, now that you've seen it, let's break in down piece by piece :)

    for(count = 0; count < 10; count++)
     |
     |__ The key word "for" signifies the start of a for loop.  You will start ALL for
    	 loops with this key word

    for(count = 0; count < 10; count++)
    	    |
    		|__ This is the "initialization part" of the for loop.  Here you will initialize
    			any variables that you want to use in the for loop.  For this program
    			"count = 0;" sets the variable count to the value of zero.  You CAN HAVE
    			for loops that don't initialize anything.  For example:

    			for(; count < 10; count++) // Notice we still HAVE TO put a semi-colon

    			So again, this "first part of the for loop" is used to initialize variables.

    for(count = 0; count < 10; count++)
    				    |
    					|__ This is the "condition part" of the for loop.  A for loop will
    						keep executing AS LONG AS this condition remains TRUE.  So for
    						our example, as long as count is LESS THAN 10, all the code in
    						the for loop (everything between the two {}'s) will keep executing.

    for(count = 0; count < 10; count++)
    							 |
    							 |__ This is the "increment part" of the for loop.  Remember
    								 for loops are designed to do "something" a certain number
    								 of times?  Well this is where we update the count of how
    								 many times we've done "something".  Here "count++" (Notice
    								 NO semi-colon) adds one to count every time we reach the
    								 BOTTOM (the } bracket) of the for loop.

    Now lets go through what happens when this program is run:

    First the variable "count" is created
    Then we begin the for loop.  First AND ONLY ONCE count is set to zero.
    Then the comparison (count < 10) is made.  If count is LESS THAN 10 the lines
    of code in the for loop are executed (the code between the {}'s is executed).
    After the last piece of code INSIDE the for loop (between the {}'s) is executed,
    the line of code "count++" (which adds one to count) is executed.

    Then we go back to the top of the for loop and check the comparison (count < 10)
    If count is LESS THAN 10 (which it is because count only now equals 1) the code between
    the {}'s is executed.  When ALL the code between the {}'s is executed, "count++" is
    executed (we add one to count, thus it now equals 2).

    And the cycle keeps repeating itself until count equals 10 and therefore,
    IS NOT LESS THAN 10.

    return 0; // Return 0 to say "Our program terminated as without any errors"
}

  Well I hope that clears up for loops a little bit.  If you're still having trouble
