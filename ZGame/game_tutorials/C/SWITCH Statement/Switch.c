//***********************************************************************//


// Below we go over using a "switch statement".  A switch statement is like
// using an if/else statement, except the format is different.  You can do
// more with if/else statements like check strings, wherease switch statements
// are generally good for just checking integer and char values.  Let's go
// through the tutorial and see how we use switch statements.


// In Visual Studio 2005 Microsoft added safer versions (denoted by a "_s" suffix) to many
// common C/C++ run time functions.  Currently the ISO Standards Committee for C and C++
// is determining if they are going to add them to the official language set.  Until then,
// this define will remove warnings about using the "unsafe" versions of these functions.
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

#include <stdio.h>							// We must include this file to use certain functions

void main()									// The beginning of our program
{
    // This starts the main function
    int number = 0;							// Initialize a integer to hold a number
    char ch = 0;							// Initialize a variable to hold a character

    // Prompt the user to enter a number from 1 to 3
    printf("Input a number between 1 and 3: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);					// Read in the number from the keyboard (%d is integer)

    // The code below is a switch statement.  Basically, what it does
    // is do a bunch of if() statements inside.  In English, the code below is
    // saying, "Check the value of number, if it's a 1, say so, if it's
    // a 2, say so, if it's a 3, also say so, but if it's none of these,
    // then tell the user they didn't follow directions."

    // You put the variable you want to evaluate between the parenthesis (<here>).
    // Then you create a new scope (The { } ).  The "case" keyword is the same
    // thing as saying, "If number's value equals 1".  Or relating to an if() statement:
    // "if(number == 1)". We put a colon after the case.  Now, if the value of "number"
    // is 1, it will do everything after the case 1: and between the "break".
    // In this case, we just print to the screen they typed the number 1, and then
    // we "break" out of this switch statement.  What the "break" does, is leaves the
    // scope of the switch statement.  So, it will go to the next line AFTER the ending '}'.
    // If we didn't have a "break" it would go to the next line, which happens to be "case 2:".
    // Once one case is evaluated to be true, then it continues to do the ones after that
    // unless there is a break. This is strange, but useful, as seen in an example below this one.

    // If none of the statements are evaluated to TRUE, then it goes down to the "default".
    // You don't have to have a default, but it's usually a good idea.

    switch(number)							// Check the value of "number"
    {
    // The beginning of the switch statement's scope
    case 1:								// If number equals 1, say so
        printf("You typed in the number 1!\n");
        break;							// Stop this and leave the switch statement

    case 2:								// If number equals 2, say so
        printf("You typed in the number 2!\n");
        break;							// break out of the switch statement

    case 3:								// If number equals 3, say so
        printf("You typed in the number 3!\n");
        break;							// break from this switch statement

    default:							// If the number isn't 1, 2 or 3, complain :)
        printf("You didn't follow directions!\n");
        break;							// We don't need this really, but I like to for consistency.
        // we will leave the switch statement anyway, that's why.
    }										// This is the END of the switch statement's scope

    // Below, we will show you an example of checking characters...

    rewind(stdin);							// This resets the input buffer, otherwise scanf() would mess up.
    // stdin stands for standard input.  It is defined in <stdio.h>.
    // Basically, it re-initializes the buffer that holds what is typed in from the keyboard.
    // It's a good idea to do this after each scanf() if you intend to use scanf() again.

    printf("\n\nInput a character: ");		// Ask for the user to input a character
    scanf("%c", &ch);						// Read in a character from the keyboard (%c is for characters)

    switch(ch)								// Check the value of "ch"
    {
    // The beginning of the switch statements scope
    case 'a':							// If ch equals 'a', say so
        printf("You typed in an A!\n");
        break;							// Stop this and leave the switch statement

    case 'b':							// If ch equals 'b', say so
        printf("You typed in an B!\n");
        break;							// break out of the switch statement

    case 'c':							// If ch equals 'c', say so
        printf("You typed in an C!\n");
        break;							// break from this switch statement

    default:							// If ch isn't 'a', 'b' or 'c', let us know
        printf("You did not type an a, b or c!\n");
        break;							// Once again we don't need this break, but it doesn't hurt.
    }

    // Well, you will notice that it only checks for LOWER CASE characters.
    // We don't want to have to make a whole new case for lower and upper case characters,
    // so here is what we do: we just add another case right after the first one, separated
    // by a colon (:).   We can do as many as we want.  We can also do it on each line, like this:
    // case 'a':
    // case 'A':
    //	printf(etc...) ...

    rewind(stdin);							// This resets the input buffer, otherwise scanf() would mess up.

    printf("\n\nInput a lowercase or uppercase character: ");
    scanf("%c", &ch);						// Read in a character from the keyboard (%c is for characters)

    switch(ch)								// Check the value of "ch"
    {
    // The beginning of the switch statements scope
    case 'a':
    case 'A':					// If ch equals 'a' or 'A', say so
        printf("You typed in an A!\n");
        break;							// Stop this and leave the switch statement

    case 'b':
    case 'B':					// If ch equals 'b' or 'B', say so
        printf("You typed in an B!\n");
        break;							// break out of the switch statement

    case 'c':
    case 'C':					// If ch equals 'c' or 'C', say so
        printf("You typed in an C!\n");
        break;							// break from this switch statement

    default:							// If ch isn't a, b or c, let us know
        printf("You did not type an a, b or c!\n");
        break;							// Once again we don't need this break, but it doesn't hurt.
    }


}											// This ends the main function (program is done)

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Switch statements are a LOT cleaner than if() statements when is comes to checking
// more than 2 or 3 values.  It is customary to use a switch statement when you have
// over 2 values to check, otherwise if() statements can get too messy.  There is some
// restrictions on switch statements though.  One of them is that it can't do strings.
// You can not do :  switch("Test") or switch(strName).  The reason is, is because a
// string is an array, and switch() statements just check a constant value.  Switch()
// statements can't do floating point numbers either, so no: switch(22.2).  This is
// unfortunate too.  The last thing that restricts switch statements is that you can't
// use expressions with the case, such as:  case (number != 2):
//
// Otherwise, switch statements are great!
//
// The rewind() function is brought up in this tutorial.  For some strange reason,
// whenever scanf() is called, it fills up the input buffer, and doesn't clear it
// afterwards.  That is what this function does, it clears the standard input buffer.
// If we didn't call this function, it would not let you type in something, but would
// assume you already did.  Try and comment it out to see what I mean.  C++ is nicer :)
