In this tutorial we create a TimeManager class that calculates the current frame rate as well
as provides a DeltaTime which is a time slice to use for making sure any movement is based on
time and not by frame counts.  We show this by rotating a triangle along the y-axis at a
constant rate.  To explain this easily, if we were to increase a rotation amount of 0.2 degrees
every time we render the scene it would move differently on different computers because some
would have faster or slower computers and see different results.  To get around this, we use
something that doesn't change from computer to computer, and that is time.  Every frame we get
a time slice (DeltaTime) that is the difference between the current time and the last frame's
time.  Now we have a value to multiply a speed by in order to move or rotate an object the
same no matter what system it's on.  We use this for camera movements or animations.

The TimeManager class uses the Singleton design pattern so that it makes sure that only one
instance of the class is ever instantiated.  This way we don't need to pass around the class
but can just access it globally through its TimeManager::Instance() function.  So if we want
to get the current time slice we just do this:

double timeSlice = TimeManager::Instance().DeltaTime;

In order for the DeltaTime to be calculated, we need to call the CalculateFrameRate() function
in the TimeManager class every frame.  We do this in our GameLoop().  We also display the
current frame rate in the console window if you set writeToConsole to true.

We get to use our rotate functionality in this tutorial and this is done by giving our model
a rotation value in radians for the y-axis by setting the y value of a vec3.  We don't use
degrees, but need to convert our degrees into radians (or 2*3.14159).  Radians are the
standard unit of angular measure, which means when you do rotation mathematics you don't
use degrees, but radians.  1 radian is equal to 57.3 degrees when the radians and arc length
are equal.  Half of a circle is measured in π (PI), and a full circle is measure in 2π. PI
is a huge number which goes on forever, but generally is shortened to 3.14 radians.  GLM
provides a radians() function that takes in degrees.  Checkout the GameLoop() function for
the rotation logic that combines with our time slice to ensure the same experience on every
device.

//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// We added a TimeManager class which uses the Singleton design pattern to give
// us a time slice every frame, which allows us to have consistent movement on
// any device.  We also added a CalculateFrameRate() that prints out the current
// frames per second to the console window if pass in true.  Keep in mind that
// if you don't turn off vertical sync then you will likely get locked at your
// monitor's refresh rate (usually 60 Hz which is 60 frames per second).  To turn
// VSync off with GLFW we do this:  glfwSwapInterval(0);
//
// On my current system I get about 7000 frames per second, what do you get? It's
// a single triangle so hopefully it's at least 1000 frames per second or you might
// need a new video card :)
