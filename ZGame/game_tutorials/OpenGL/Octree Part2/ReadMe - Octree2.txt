Files:  	Main.cpp (The Source File containing the main program code)
		Init.cpp (The Source File containing the Win32 and OpenGL initialization code)
		Camera.cpp (The Source File containing the camera class implementation)
		Frustum.cpp (The Source File containing the frustum implementation)
		Octree.cpp (The Source File containing the octree implementation)
		Octree.h (The Header File containing "octree" definitions)
		Frustum.h (The Header File containing the "frustum" definitions)
		Camera.h (The Header File containing the camera class definition)
		main.h (The Header File containing definitions for the main program)
		Octree2.vcxproj  (The VC++ Project File holding the project info)
		Octree2.sln  (The Solution File holding the solution info)
		Terrain.raw (The map file)
		Octree HTML Tutorial DIR (The Directory holding an HTML octree tutorial) 

Libraries:	opengl32.lib (The OpenGL Interface Library needed to compile the program)
		glu32.lib (The OpenGL Utility Library needed to compile the program)

Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 just click on the
		<Program Name>.vcxproj file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.cpp.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .cpp extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it
 will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		the Win32 program should pop up. :)
