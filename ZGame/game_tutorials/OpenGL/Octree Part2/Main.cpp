//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial was an add on to the last octree tutorial which just showed us
// how to create an octree.  There wasn't a lot added, but the power that is provides
// is incredible.  We now have a functional octree that only draws the vertices in
// our view.  There are 2 things we added to this tutorial since the last:
//
// 1) We added the frustum code (frustum.cpp and frustum.h).  This is all explained
// in our frustum tutorial on our site if you don't understand the code.  Once we
// create our global CFrustum object: g_Frustum, we just need to call this every frame:
//
// g_Frustum.CalculateFrustum();
//
// We only really need to call it when the camera moves but you can do those checks
// yourself.  Then, once the frustum planes are calculated we can use this function to
// check if the end nodes are in our frustum:
//
// g_Frustum.CubeInFrustum(center.x, center.y, center.z, cubeWidth / 2);
//
// That's it for the frustum!  Simple, yet wonderfully usefull.  We left in the sphere
// and point code in frustum.cpp from the frustum tutorial just so if you wanted to
// include the frustum.cpp file in your application/game you didn't have to copy and
// paste them back in.  Just ingore those for this tutorial though.
//
// 2) Finally we added a counter (g_TotalNodesDrawn) to tell us how many of the end
// nodes are being drawn.  This let's us know how well the octree is working.  You
// can view this information in the window's title bar, along with the other subdivision
// information.
//
// Also notice that we took our the rotating.  This is so all the cubes stay axis aligned.
//
// Hopefully by breaking the octree tutorial up into multiple parts it isn't so hard
// to digest.  The next tutorial will focus on reading in a real world with texture
// information, normals, etc...  Then you can actually use this code in a project.
// I also included the HTML octree tutorial with this tutorial as well just in case
// some people didn't want to download the first octree tutorial but wanted to get right
// to the good stuff.  This HTML file will explain in more detail the octree theory, etc...
//
// Good luck!
