// Because in our future tutorials we will be reusing all of this code quite often,

// just copy 3DMath.cpp and 3DMath.h into a new project without having to cut and paste code.
// Eventually, once this gets big enough you will probably want to make a library out of it.

// *FINDING THE INTERSECTION OF A LINE AND PLANE*


// We added 2 functions to this math file:  PlaneDistance() and IntersectPlane().
// This will enable us to check if a line intersects a plane.  The next tutorial
// go go farther in depth and check a line against a polygon, not just it's plane.
// The most important part of this tutorial is the plane equation, Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.

    CVector3 vNormal = Normal(vTriangle);				 // We need to get the normal of our plane to go any further

    // Now that we have the normal, we need to calculate the distance our triangle is from the origin.
    // Since we would have the same triangle, but -10 down the z axis, we need to know
    // how far our plane is to the origin.  The origin is (0, 0, 0), so we need to find
    // the shortest distance our plane is from (0, 0, 0).  This way we can test the collision.
    // The direction the plane is facing is important (We know this by the normal), but it's
    // also important WHERE that plane is in our 3D space.  I hope this makes sense.

    // We created a function to calculate the distance for us.  All we need is the normal
    // of the plane, and then ANY point located on that plane.  Well, we have 3 points.  Each
    // point of the triangle is on the plane, so we just pass in one of our points.  It doesn't
    // matter which one, so we will just pass in the first one.  We get a single value back.
    // That is the distance.  Just like our normalized normal is of length 1, our distance
    // is a single value too.  It's like if you were to measure something with a ruler,
    // you don't measure it according to the X Y and Z of our world, you just want ONE number.

    float originDistance = PlaneDistance(vNormal, vTriangle[0]);

    // Now the next step is simple, but hard to understand at first.  What we need to
    // do is get the distance of EACH point from out plane.  Above we got the distance of the
    // plane to the point (0, 0, 0) which happens to be the origin, now we need to get a distance
    // for each point.  If the distance is a negative number, then the point is BEHIND the plane.
    // If the distance is positive, then the point is in front of the plane.  Basically, if the
    // line collides with the plane, there should be a negative and positive distance.  make sense?
    // If the line pierces the plane, it will have a negative distance and a positive distance,
    // meaning that a point will be on one side of the plane, and one point on the other.  But we
    // will do the check after this, first we need to get the distance of each point to the plane.

    // Now, we need to use something called the plane equation to get the distance from each point.
    // Here is the plane Equation:  (Ax + By + Cz + D = The distance from the plane)
    // If "The distance from the plane" is 0, that means that the point is ON the plane, which all the polygon points should be.
    // A, B and C is the Normal's X Y and Z values.  x y and z is the Point's x y and z values.
    // "the Point" meaning one of the points of our line.  D is the distance that the plane
    // is from the origin.  We just calculated that and stored it in "originDistance".
    // Let's fill in the equation with our data:

    // Get the distance from point1 from the plane using: Ax + By + Cz + D = (The distance from the plane)

    distance1 = ((vNormal.x * vLine[0].x)  +					// Ax +
                 (vNormal.y * vLine[0].y)  +					// Bx +
                 (vNormal.z * vLine[0].z)) + originDistance;	// Cz + D

    // We just got the first distance from the first point to the plane, now let's get the second.

    // Get the distance from point2 from the plane using Ax + By + Cz + D = (The distance from the plane)

    distance2 = ((vNormal.x * vLine[1].x)  +					// Ax +
                 (vNormal.y * vLine[1].y)  +					// Bx +
                 (vNormal.z * vLine[1].z)) + originDistance;	// Cz + D

    // Ok, we should have 2 distances from the plane, from each point of our line.
    // Remember what I said about an intersection?  If one is negative and one is positive,
    // that means that they are both on either side of the plane.  So, all we need to do
    // is multiply the 2 distances together, and if the result is less than 0, we intersection.
    // This works because, any number times a negative number is always negative, IE (-1 * 1 = -1)
    // If they are both positive or negative values then it will be above zero.

    if(distance1 * distance2 >= 0)			// Check to see if both point's distances are both negative or both positive
        return false;						// Return false if each point has the same sign.  -1 and 1 would mean each point is on either side of the plane.  -1 -2 or 3 4 wouldn't...

    return true;							// The line intersected the plane, Return TRUE

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// That's all we need to find if a ray (line) and plane intersect.  Pretty simple eh?
// I think it's not too complicated.  Once you understand the a cool math function
// called the dot product, it starts to make sense.  We will learn more about this in
// the next collision tutorial.  That is when stuff actually start getting complicated.
// Right now, all we can collide with is a plane.  In the next tutorial we will be
// able to just collide with the polygon, not just the plane the polygon is on.
//
// Here are some of the more important steps to finding the intersection of a line and plane:
//
// 1) First we need a polygon (at least 3 points) and a line segment.  We then find
//    the normal of the polygon.
//
// 2) Once we have the normal, we want to find the distance the plane is from the origin.
//    We use the plane equation (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0) to find the distance.
//	  We want D, so we turn that into D = -(Ax + By + Cz)
//
// 3) With the distance, we can now fill in the rest of the plane equation to find
//    the distance a point is from the plane.  So (Ax + By + Cz + D = The distance from the plane)
//    A B C is the plane's normal.X normal.Y normal.Z, and x y z is the point's x y z value.
//    We get the first points distance, then get the second points distance.
//
// 4) If we times the 2 distances of each point together, we either get a positive or negative number.
//    If the number is negative, that means we collided because each distance had to be the opposite value.
//    If the result is positive, that means that the 2 points were on the same side of the plane as each other.
//
// That's it!
