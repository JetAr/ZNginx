// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This is a lot of structures/class and code to look over, so take your time and dissect
// each one of them to see where they come into play and what is loaded into them.
// The most important is the CLoadMD3 class and it's definitions.  This is because you
// can't really do it another way since the file format is required to be read in that way.
// Of course, you don't need to use the ConvertDataStructures() function, but I do.
// The rest of the code, like the CModelMD3 class is just my quick implementation to
// get the model loaded, drawn, then freed.
//
// Take a look at the bottom of MD3.cpp for a explanation of what all this stuff does.
// Let me know your comments and suggestion!
