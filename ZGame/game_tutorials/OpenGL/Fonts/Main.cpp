// We are going to learn a couple new things in this tutorial.
// 1) What display list's are
// 2) How to create and setup a handle to a font
//
// OpenGL has some functions that make using fonts extremely easy.
// There are many ways to do fonts, but one of the easiest ways to do it
// comes from NeHe's tutorials (nehe.gamedev.net).  We can create a display
// list holding every character, and then pass in that list to an OpenGL function
// called wglUseFontBitmaps that will do the work for us.  What is a display list you ask?
// A display list is used to speed up your program and cutting down your code by storing
// OpenGL objects/polygons/primitives which you can then access by a number.  For example,
// If you have the same object in your world a bunch of times, there is no need to pass in
// the vertices to OpenGL every time you want to render an instance of that object, you can just
// tell OpenGL about it, which stores it in a list, then you can just call that list.  This
// is faster than drawing the same thing 30 times because you only have to give OpenGL the
// vertices once.  Say you wanted to render 30 models of bad guys.  You just need to make
// a display list for the model, and then call that list by it's ID to render another.
// That is what we are doing with the font.  We just create a list that holds every character
// in the alphabet that we would use and then just access that character by it's ASCII value later.
// It will make sense as we go along.  Some of the font API's are just for windows.  You might
// need to do it the old fashion way by loading in parts of a bitmap if you aren't using windows.

// This is an unsigned int (since we can't have a negative base pointer) that will hold
// the ID for our display list.  It isn't so much of an ID, but it's easier to think of it
// that way.  We we create a display list, we start at 1.  If we create another one we
// then move the list pointer to 2.  g_FontListID holds the BASE number for the display list.
// We are going to create 256 lists for all the characters we need, so we will start at one,
// and the list pointer will then be at 257 if you create another list.  When using display
// lists, we need the base pointer to tell OpenGL which list number we are starting at.
// This will make more sense in the function below.
UINT g_FontListID = 0;

// This will save our old font and select it back in at the end of our program.
// We need this because we use SelectObject() to select in the new font.
// We don't want any memory leaks :)
HFONT hOldFont;

// This define is for the amount of lists we want to create.  There will need to be 1
// for every character.  Since there are 256 ascii characters, we will use 256.
// If we only wanted certain characters used, like alpha numerics, we would give less.
#define MAX_CHARS	256

// This defines how high we want our font to be
#define FONT_HEIGHT	32

///////////////////////////////// CREATE OPENGL FONT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
/////
/////	This function creates a windows font like "Arial" and returns a display list ID
/////
///////////////////////////////// CREATE OPENGL FONT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

UINT CreateOpenGLFont(LPSTR strFontName, int height)	// Build Our Bitmap Font
{
    UINT	fontListID = 0;								// This will hold the base ID for our display list
    HFONT	hFont;										// This will store the handle to our font

    // Here we generate the lists for each character we want to use.
    // This function then returns the base pointer, which will be 1 because
    // we haven't created any other lists.  If we generated another list after
    // this, the base pointer would be at 257 since the last one used was 256 (which is MAX_CHARS)
    fontListID = glGenLists(MAX_CHARS);					// Generate the list for the font

    // Now we actually need to create the font.  We use a windows function called:
    // CreateFont() that returns a handle to a font (HFONT).  Our CreateOpenGLFont()
    // function allows us to pass in a name and height.  For simplistic reasons, I left
    // other options out, but feel free to add them to your function (like bold, italic, width..)

    hFont = CreateFont(	height,							// Our desired HEIGHT of the font
                        0,								// The WIDTH (If we leave this zero it will pick the best width depending on the height)
                        0,								// The angle of escapement
                        0,								// The angle of orientation
                        FW_BOLD,						// The font's weight (We want it bold)
                        FALSE,							// Italic - We don't want italic
                        FALSE,							// Underline - We don't want it underlined
                        FALSE,							// Strikeout - We don't want it strikethrough
                        ANSI_CHARSET,					// This is the type of character set
                        OUT_TT_PRECIS,					// The Output Precision
                        CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,			// The Clipping Precision
                        ANTIALIASED_QUALITY,			// The quality of the font - We want anitaliased fonts
                        FF_DONTCARE|DEFAULT_PITCH,		// The family and pitch of the font.  We don't care.
                        strFontName);					// The font name (Like "Arial", "Courier", etc...)

    // Now that we have created a new font, we need to select that font into our global HDC.
    // We store the old font so we can select it back in when we are done to avoid memory leaks.
    hOldFont = (HFONT)SelectObject(g_hDC, hFont);

    // This function does the magic.  It takes the current font selected in
    // the hdc and makes bitmaps out of each character.  These are called glyphs.
    // The first parameter is the HDC that holds the font to be used.
    // The second parameters is the ASCII value to start from, which is zero in our case.
    // The third parameters is the ASCII value to end on (255 is the last of the ASCII values so we minus 1 from MAX_CHARS)
    // The last parameter is the base pointer for the display lists being used.  This should be 1.

    wglUseFontBitmaps(g_hDC, 0, MAX_CHARS - 1, fontListID);	// Builds 255 bitmap characters

    return fontListID;									// Return the ID to the display list to use later
}

///////////////////////////////// POSITION TEXT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
/////
/////	This function sets the drawing position for the text
/////
///////////////////////////////// POSITION TEXT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

void PositionText( int x, int y )
{
    // If you are to use this font code for your applications,
    // you must be aware that you cannot position the font in 3D,
    // which means you can't rotate and scale it.  That will be covered in
    // the next font tutorial.  BUT, though that might be a drag, this code
    // is useful because when you display the text, it will always be on top
    // of everything else.  This is good if the camera is moving around, and you
    // don't want the text to move.  If the text was positioned in 3D you would have
    // to come up with a tricky way of making it always render in front of the camera.
    // To do this, we need to set the Raster Position.  That is the position that OpenGL
    // starts drawing at.  Since it's in floating point, it's not very intuitive, so what
    // we do is create a new view port, and then always draw the text at (0, 0, 0) in that
    // view port.  The weird part is that the Y is flipped, so (0, 0) is the bottom left corner.
    // Below we do some simple math to flip it back to normal.

    // Before we create a new view port, we need to save the current one we have.
    // This saves our transform (matrix) information and our current viewport information.
    // At the end of this function we POP it back.
    glPushAttrib( GL_TRANSFORM_BIT | GL_VIEWPORT_BIT );

    // Here we use a new projection and modelview matrix to work with.
    glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );						// Set our matrix to our projection matrix
    glPushMatrix();										// Push on a new matrix to work with
    glLoadIdentity();									// reset the matrix
    glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW );						// Set our matrix to our model view matrix
    glPushMatrix();										// Push on a new matrix to work with
    glLoadIdentity();									// Reset that matrix

    // Because the Y is flipped, we want 0 to be at the top, not bottom.
    // If we subtract the font height from the screen height, that should display the
    // font at the top of the screen (if they passed in 0 for Y), but then we subtract
    // the Y from that to get the desired position.  Since the font's drawing point is
    // at the base line of the font, we needed to subtract the font height to make sure
    // if they passed in (0, 0) it wouldn't be off screen.  If you view this in window mode,
    // the top of the window will cut off part of the font, but in full screen it works fine.
    // You just need to add about 25 to the Y to fix that for window mode.

    y = SCREEN_HEIGHT - FONT_HEIGHT - y;				// Calculate the weird screen position

    // Now we create another view port (that is why we saved the old one above).
    // Since glViewPort takes the lower LEFT corner, we needed to change the Y
    // to make it more intuitive when using PositionText().  We minus 1 from the X and Y
    // because 0 is taken into account with the position.  The next 2 parameters are set
    // to 0 for the width and height so it will always draw in the middle of that position.
    // glRasterPos4f() takes (0, 0, 0) as the middle of the viewport, so if we give it a small
    // width/height it will draw at the X and Y given.  Sounds strange, to test this, try
    // using glRasterPos4f(0, 0, 0, 1) instead of PositionText() and you will see, everything
    // will be drawn from the middle.

    glViewport( x - 1, y - 1, 0, 0 );					// Create a new viewport to draw into

    // This is the most important function in here.  This actually positions the text.
    // The parameters are (x, y, z, w).  w should always be 1 , it's a clip coordinate.
    // don't worry about that though.  Because we set the projection and modelview matrix
    // back to the beginning (through LoadIdentity()), the view port is looking at (0, 0, 0).
    // This is the middle, so if we set the drawing position to the middle, it will draw at our
    // X and Y because the width/height of the viewport is 0, starting at X and Y.
    // You can actually call this function (or glRasterPos2f(0, 0)) instead of PositionText(),
    // but it is in floating point and doesn't work as nicely.  You will see why if you try.

    glRasterPos4f( 0, 0, 0, 1 );						// Set the drawing position

    // Now that we positioned the raster position, any text we draw afterwards will start
    // from that position.  Now we just have to put everything else back to normal.

    glPopMatrix();										// Pop the current modelview matrix off the stack
    glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );						// Go back into projection mode
    glPopMatrix();										// Pop the projection matrix off the stack

    glPopAttrib();										// This restores our TRANSFORM and VIEWPORT attributes

    // If you have never used a va_list, listen up.  Remember printf()?
    // or sprintf()?  Well, you can add unlimited arguments into the text like:
    // printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old!", strName, age);
    // Well, that is what va_list's do.

    // First we need to check if there was even a string given
    if (strString == NULL)								// Check if a string was given
        return;											// Don't render anything then

    // First we need to parse the string for arguments given
    // To do this we pass in a va_list variable that is a pointer to the list of arguments.
    // Then we pass in the string that holds all of those arguments.
    va_start(argumentPtr, strString);					// Parse the arguments out of the string

    // Then we use a special version of sprintf() that takes a pointer to the argument list.
    // This then does the normal sprintf() functionality.
    vsprintf(strText, strString, argumentPtr);			// Now add the arguments into the full string

    va_end(argumentPtr);								// This resets and frees the pointer to the argument list.

    // Before we draw the text, we need to position it with our own function.

    // Now, before we set the list base, we need to save off the current one.
    glPushAttrib(GL_LIST_BIT);							// This saves the list base information

    // Then we want to set the list base to the font's list base, which should be 1 in our case.
    // That way when we call our display list it will start from the font's lists'.
    glListBase(g_FontListID);							// This sets the lists base

    // Now comes the actually rendering.  We pass in the length of the string,
    // then the data types (which are characters so its a UINT), then the actually char array.
    // This will then take the ASCII value of each character and associate it with a bitmap.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial covers how to use display lists and more importantly, how to display
// text to the screen in OpenGL.  The next font tutorial will allow you to display 3D text.
// Then you can rotate and scale it to your hearts delight.
//
// Remember though, when using this 2D text, it will always be in front of the screen.
// This could be good and bad, depending on what you are doing.  You can use the code
// for PositionText() to draw bitmaps the same way, so they will always be in front.
// To do that, you would use glDrawPixels().  This might be discussed later in another tutorial.
//
// If you are uncomfortable with all the funky code in PositionText(), you can just use
// glRasterPos2f().  This takes an X and Y position the same way, but it's in floating point.
// If you said glRasterPos2f(0, 0) it wouldn't put the text in the top left corner of the screen,
// it would put it in the middle of the screen, depending on some other things....
// It isn't really intuitive and you have to do a lot of guessing, so go ahead and see what
// you like better.
//
// Let's go over some of the basics of what we did in this tutorial.
//
// 1) First, we needed to create a display list for each character.  To do that
//    we used:
//
//			glGenLists( /* Max Characters */ );
//
//	  This returns a base pointer to use when referencing this group of display lists.
//
// 2) Then we needed to create a font.  To create a font in windows we used:
//
//			CreateFont( /*Huge list of arguments for the font */ );
//
//	  This function returns a handle to a font (HFONT).  We then need to select
//    that into our global HDC.
//
// 3) Now that we have a display lists saved and a font selected, we can fill in the lists.
//
//			wglUseFontBitmaps( /* hdc, starting list pointer, max lists, base pointer */ );
//
//	  This function above actually creates the bitmaps from the font and stores them in the lists.
//
// 4) Now that we created our display lists and filled them in with the font, we actually want
//    to display them.  We uses a va_list with stands for "Variable Argument List".  This allows
//    us to give our glDisplayText() function arguments, like printf()/sprintf() do.  This is
//    not an OpenGL thing.
//
// 5) After we extract the string we want to display using va_start(), vsprintf() and va_end(),
//    we then want to position the text on the screen.  This was a hairy weird part.  Basically,
//    what we did was create another viewport, and give it a width and height of 0.  This was
//    we could set the RasterPosition to (0, 0, 0, 1) and it would start the text at that X Y given.
//    Read above for more information on this, it's too long to explain again.
//
// 6) Once the text is positioned, we want to actually draw it!  First we save the list state:
//
//			glPushAttrib(GL_LIST_BIT);		// This saves the list base information
//
//			glListBase(g_FontListID);		// Then we set the list base information
//
//			// Then we actually draw the text, with each character's ASCII value referencing the associated bitmap
//
//			glCallLists( /* number of lists,  type,  array holding list number */ );
//
//			glPopAttrib();					// Then we set the list base back to what it was
//
// 7) We can also change the color of the text by using any GL color function like glColor3f();
//
// 8) Once we are finished, we need to clean up.  We do this calling:
//
//			glDeleteLists( /* base list,  number of lists */ );
//
//    Then we need to select the old font back into our HDC as to avoid memory leaks.
//
// That is pretty much it in a nutshell!  If you don't understand what is going on,
// try changing some things around, and hopefully it will hit you after much depression :)
// You might even just want to copy the code if you aren't interested in how it works.
// The next tutorial on text will be 3D text and won't be so boring.  Let me know if this helped!
//
