// *OBJECT SELECTING*

// This tutorial was created to show you how to select objects in 3D.
// Basically, what you are doing is taking an X and Y coordinate of the mouse
// and checking to see if any objects are in that region when projected to 2D from 3D.
// This can be very useful for level editors and menu/interface situations.
// The basic concept is, before you draw an object, you just assign an ID to it.


#define SUN				100								// This is the object ID for the SUN	
#define EARTH			101								// This is the object ID for the EARTH
#define PLUTO			102								// This is the object ID for PLUTO

        // holds it.  For every object there is 4 values.  The first value is
        // "the number of names in the name stack at the time of the event, followed

//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This is probably our most complicated tutorial in OpenGL so far.  It gets into
// a lot of the tricky parts of matrices.  If you don't understand how a projection
// or model view matrix works, I would suggest looking up the nitty gritty details.
// It helps you really understand what OpenGL is doing.  Of course, you can always
// just shrug it off and say, "Well, I know it works and I have code to prove it!",
// but this will come to haunt you later when you want to do your own stuff.  You won't
// know what to do and how to effectively use OpenGL.  Eventually we will write some papers
// on this subject, but for now we want to focus mostly on code tutorials.
//
// So, how do you feel?  Do you have tons of ideas yet on what this could be used for?
// The first thing that comes to mind for me is interface stuff.  If you are going to
// have cool 3D menus, or a level editor you need to be able to identify what the heck
// the user is trying to click on.
//
// You will notice that we took out all the full screen code.  That is because it's
// better to see in a window for the first time, also some people's machines handle the cursor
// differently (it won't show up in full screen).  You can mess around with full screen yourself.
//
// Let's go over some of the steps in order to allow this magic to happen:
//
// 1)  Once we find the X and Y position we want to check, we then setup our
//     array to hold the selection data.  To do this we call:
//
//          glSelectBuffer(int SIZE, unsigned int ARRAY);
//
// 2) We will need our view port coordinates, so we call:
//
//	       glGetIntegerv(GL_VIEWPORT, int viewportArray[4]);
//
// 3) Next, we need to be in projection mode so we can work with 2D in 3D space.
//    After we make this switch, we need to get out of RENDER mode and into SELECT mode:
//
//	       glRenderMode(GL_SELECT);
//
// 4) Now that we won't be rendering, but getting information, we need to tell OpenGL where
//    to look for the objects.  We do this by creating a region with:
//
//         gluPickMatrix(xPos, yPos, width, height, int viewport[4])
//
// 5) Next, we call gluPerspective() to create the correct projection matrix for that region.
//    We then need to select our mode view matrix in so we can draw the objects into the
//    selection buffer, NOT the frame buffer (because we are in GL_SELECT mode).
//    We call glInitNames() to clear the name stack (It does this anyway when going in GL_SELECT mode)
//
// 6) Before we render an object in, we need to tag an ID with that object so we know how to
//    reference it later.  To do this, we call:
//
//	       glPushName(ID);  // The ID is our ID for the object to reference later
//
//    Then we call glPopName(); to stop assigning polygons to that object's ID.
//
// 7) Next, we want to go back to normal render mode.  Since we were just in GL_SELECT
//    mode, we get back the number of objects hit when we call:
//
//	       numberOfObjectsHit = glRenderMode(GL_RENDER);
//
// 8) We close the current projection matrix by switching back to GL_PROJECTION,
//	  then we go back into our model view matrix.
//
// 9) Finally, we should have the object ID's that we clicked stored in selectBuffer.
//    Each object has 4 slots of information [0 - 3] , [4 - 7], etc...
//    We only want the second and fourth because it holds the minimum depth and objectID.
//	  Depending on how many objects we want to check simultaneously, we need to make our
//    selection buffer bigger (the size should be (4 * objects) since the first 2/3 of the slots
//    holds depth information for each object).  Once again, be aware that if you render
//    2D texture or a fade/flash quad in front of you it will count that as an object clicked.
//    This is bad of course, so find a way (I used a flag) to NOT render those when you check.
//    If you don't call glLoadName() before rendering something, it's objectID will be 0.
//
// !WARNING!  Some cards (like Voodoo) will staul when using the glPushName()/glPopName()
// functions.  So if this tutorial is grinding along on your box, chances are your card does
// not support these calls.
//
