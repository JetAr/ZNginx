/*
In this tutorial we added a way for us to rotate our camera by moving the mouse around, like
what you would see in a first person game.  This is done by just exposing a new
SetViewByMouse() function which takes a mouse x and y delta to rotate the yaw and pitch from.
We also can cap the rotations to make sure we don't allow the user to look to high or below.

// Initialize the camera to have a position at the origin
Camera::Camera()
{
    // Set the default position for the camera to the origin
    Position = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

// This sets and returns the camera's perspective matrix from a field of view (in radians), aspect ratio
// and the near and far planes which cull the geometry outside our desired viewing distance.
mat4 Camera::SetPerspective(float fov, float aspectRatio, float nearPlane, float farPlane)
{
    // Create the projection matrix with GLM's perspective function, replacing gluPerspective.
    ProjectionMatrix = perspective(fov, aspectRatio, nearPlane, farPlane);

    return ProjectionMatrix;

// This function sets the camera's position and rotation values
void Camera::PositionCamera(float positionX, float positionY, float positionZ, float yaw, float pitch)
{
    // Assign our camera variables
    Position = vec3( positionX, positionY, positionZ );
    Yaw = yaw;
    Pitch = pitch;
}


// This builds and returns a rotation matrix from the yaw and pitch rotations
mat4 Camera::GetRotationMatrix()

    // Create an identity matrix

    rotationMatrix = rotate(rotationMatrix, Yaw, vec3(0, 1, 0));

    return rotationMatrix;

// This returns the camera's view matrix that is used to pass to our shaders
mat4 Camera::GetViewMatrix()
{
    // Return a view matrix by multiplying our rotation matrix by the inverse of a translation matrix
    return GetRotationMatrix() * inverse(translate(mat4(), Position));

vec3 Camera::GetView()
{
    // Calculate the view vector by taking the inverse of our rotation matrix multiplied by a vector
    // looking down the negative z-axis.

    // We are using a 4x4 matrix so our result is a vec4, but just turn it back into a vec3
    return vec3(viewVector);

// This returns the camera's up vector (the direction pointing up) from the rotation matrix

{
    // Calculate the up vector by taking the inverse of the rotation matrix multiplied by a
    // default up vector.

    // We are using a 4x4 matrix so our result is a vec4, but just cast it back to a vec3

// This will move the camera forward or backward depending on the speed
void Camera::MoveCamera(float speed)
{
    // Get our normalized view vector (The direction we are facing)
    vec3 viewVector = GetView();

    // Move our camera position forward or backward along the view vector
    Position.x += viewVector.x * speed;		// Add our acceleration to our position's X
    Position.z += viewVector.z * speed;		// Add our acceleration to our position's Z

// This sets the pitch and yaw of our camera from the mouse x and y deltas from the last frame

    Pitch += yOffset * MouseSpeed;

    // If the yaw goes above 360 degrees (2 PI in radians) then set it back to 0 so
    // we keep the rotation between 0 and 360 degrees.  This is just a preference of working
    // with 0-360 instead of 570+, etc...

        Yaw = 0;

    // Cap the yaw between 0 and 360

    // Let's cap the pitch to 75 degrees up and -75 degrees down.  This makes it so you don't
    // have the camera flipping upside down if you look to far up or down.  There could be a
    // reason though to want to allow that, especially in a scripting camera.  This also can
    // avoid the "gimbal lock" issue where if you look straight up or down it wigs out.  This
    // can be avoided with quaternion rotations instead of euler rotations too.
    if ( Pitch > radians(75.0f) )
        Pitch = radians(75.0f);

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This is our Camera class which controls the user's view in the 3D world.  In
// this tutorial we added a new function SetViewByMouse() to rotate our camera's
// view by mouse x and y deltas.  We also cap the pitch so it doesn't make the
// camera go upside down.
