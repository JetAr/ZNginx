In this tutorial we added a way for us to rotate our camera by moving the mouse around,
similar to how the camera movements would work in a first person game.  To make things more
interesting we build a tower of quads (3D rectangles) to look at.  There is very little
that we added extra in order to accomplish this, partly because we already have our rotation
and view matrices setup to be calculated from our Yaw and Pitch rotations.  Now we just need
to update those Yaw and Pitch values in order to move the camera around freely.  We also go
over how to manage the mouse with GLFW.  Once again, just a few function calls and we have
a working mouse controlled camera.

*How the mouse rotates the camera*
How a mouse controlled camera works is we check the current mouse x and y offsets every
frame and then take the delta movements from the last frame.  We then add a rotation to
the Yaw (xOffset) and Pitch (yOffset) values.  So if you were to move your mouse to the right
it would increase the mouseX position and then we would need to add that value to the Yaw with
a MouseSpeed setting for sensitivity.  These rotation changes are in radians so we use a
MouseSpeed of 0.001 to multiply by the mouseX and mouseY so it doesn't rotate 180 degrees
if you move 3 pixels to the right.  We don't need to multiply by a time slice because it's
really how fast you move your mouse that will make the difference, not your CPU speed.

It's really as simple as this:
Yaw += xOffset * MouseSpeed;
Pitch += yOffset * MouseSpeed;

We can also easily cap the angle the camera can look by just checking the pitch or yaw
go above or below a certain angle (in radians).

So there are 2 ways you can get the mouse x and y deltas.  You can force the cursor to
be in the middle of the screen every frame and then subtract the new mouse position from
the center of the screen (or last mouse position).  This would give you a xOffset and
yOffset to work with.  This is what we did in our legacy OpenGL tutorials, but this time
we will do it a little easier where we don't need to store the center or last position,
but just force the cursor position to be at (0, 0) every frame and then we get the
current mouse location and then reset it back to (0,0) after we are done.  This gives
us a perfect delta for the new mouse position.

*GLFW mouse management*
In GLFW, we can hide the mouse cursor, get the current location and then also set its
position.  We will use these functions in this tutorial so that the user isn't seeing
the mouse cursor flicker back and forth every frame in the top left corner of the screen.
The get and set functions will also allow us to force the cursor to (0,0), get the delta
position for that frame, then reset it back to (0, 0).  Here is how we hide the cursor:

glfwSetInputMode(Window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED);

We do this in our Initialize() function of our GLFWManager class.  We then want to set
the cursor position to (0, 0) so we can start getting the mouse position deltas:

glfwSetCursorPos(Window, 0, 0);

To get the current mouse position we use this with a couple local double variables:

glfwGetCursorPos(Window, &mouseX, &mouseY);

So every frame in our ProcessInput() function we will first get the cursor position,
send the new mouse offsets to our InputManager->MouseMoved(mouseX, mouseY), then reset
the cursor position back to (0, 0).

*InputManager::MouseMoved()*
We created a new function called MouseMoved() in our InputManager and all it does is
just pass those new mouse positions down to our Camera->SetViewByMouse(mouseX, mouseY).

*Camera::SetViewByMouse()*
We added one more function to our Camera class to handle the rotations by the mouse,
called SetViewByMouse().  This takes in the x and y offsets from the current mouse
position and then as we showed above, adds those to our Yaw and Pitch.

NOTE: We changed our Vertex3 class to use glm:vec3 and glm:vec4 for the position and
color properties.  This makes it easier to work with going forward.

That's it!  Since we already are building our rotation matrix each frame, the Yaw and
Pitch value changes will already be combined into our view matrix.  The next tutorial
will show you how to add strafing to the camera, so LEFT/RIGHT and A/D keys will move
perpendicular to the camera's view like in most any first person game.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// In this file we added a little more interesting objects to look at by building
// a tower of quads that get smaller and then bigger as they reach the top.  This
// is done by drawing 40 triangles to make up 20 quads.  You can move around and
// go look at the tower.  You start inside the bottom so step back until you can
// see it.  Instead of our g_Triangle object we created a g_Model object instead.
// You'll notice that we also use glm::vec3 and glm::vec4 objects instead of an
// array of floats for our Vertex3 properties.
