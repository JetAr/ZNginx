// This tutorial was taken from the Camera2 tutorial.  So far we had only first
// person camera tutorials, but now we move into the realm of 3rd person views.
// Some games that use this view are "Metal Gear Solid", "Tomb Raider",
// "My Little Pony's Revenge" (okay.. I made that up).  This can be a tricky
// mode for a game because the feel and movement can be uncomfortable if you
// don't get it just right.  Many people complain about this view.  Another bad
// thing about this view is that it makes you render your character all the time
// which can slow down the frame rate.  In first person shooters you only have
// to render the people you come in contact with, which saves a bit of frame rate.
// A cool thing about this mode is that it lets you see what your character looks
// like and how they react to objects and characters/monsters in the world.  This
// tutorial adds very little code to the second camera tutorial to accomplish this
// result.  All we really did was add the function RotateAroundPoint() to our CCamera class.
// This rotates the camera around a certain point.  What point would that be?  Well, you
// usually want it to be your m_vView point (the place you are looking).  You can then
// set the position of your character at that point as well, which we do.  You might not
// always want to rotate around the view point, so we allow you to pass in your own
// center point to RotateAroundPoint().  This tutorial just creates a simple object
// in a simple world that moves around with you in third person.  The object would be
// replaced with your character, but for the sake of simplicity we create something easy.
// Use the arrow keys to move around.  You will notice when you hit the left or right arrow
// keys the camera will rotate around the object.  Just imagine that is your character.
// This tutorial doesn't do the full third person view like in Tomb Raider, but
// if you understand these basics, you can finish the rest.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial demonstrates how to do a third person camera view.  There is a lot
// more that this view deals with, but this is the basics.  How it's done is really
// simple.  Instead of rotating the view around the position, you just rotate the
// position around the view.  I just took RotateView() and swapped the places that
// m_vView was with m_vPosition and vice versa.  However, we use vCenter because we
// might not always want to use the view, it could be some other point.  That way
// it's modular and doesn't have to just be rotating around the view.  In this
// tutorial we just pass in g_Camera.m_View for the point to rotate around.
//
// Not much else to say about this, so I hope this helps someone out that might
// be struggling with this.  You can use the arrow keys to move around the world.
//
// Enjoy!
