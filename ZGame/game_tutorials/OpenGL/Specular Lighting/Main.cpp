// This tutorials shows you how to add specular lighting to your scene.
// Specular lighting is the intense white light created on shiny objects,
// like metalic surfaces.  The code for this tutorial is created off of
// the Quadric tutorial.  Very little code is added or changed.  If you
// are not comfortable with Quadrics, I left the comments explaining what
// is going on.  If you are familiar with them, you can just focus on
// the Init() function.  That is all that is need to set the specular lighting.
// Also, this tutorial still allows the user to click the left mouse button
// and turn the cylinder to and from wire frame mode.  We did add the option
// now to increase and decrease the shininess value by using the '-' and '+' keys.

bool  g_bFullScreen = TRUE;								// Set full screen as default

HINSTANCE g_hInstance;									// This holds the global hInstance for UnregisterClass() in DeInit()


// This is effected when we click the LEFT mouse button.  It determines if
// the cylinder is draw in lines or in fill mode.  This was we can see through it.

// around 50 is the lowest amount.  You can use the '+' and '-' keys to
// change this value when running the application.

    // That's it!  That is how we add specular.  Simple huh?  It is such a cool

    // suggest adding specular to some objects that aren't so rounded.  I didn't
    // want to complicate the tutorial so I just chose a sphere and a cylinder.
    // The only other thing we do with specular in this tutorial is down in
    // the WinProc().  I give the user the option of changing the intensity.
    // If you want to change the DIFFUSE color use GL_DIFFUSE and pass in a
    // array with the color values to glMaterialfv().

    // Since a cylinder is created going down the Z axis, we want to rotate
    // it so it is going down the X axis.  This way the sphere can go through it.
    // We don't want to translate and rotate the sphere, so we use another matrix to
    // do this stuff.  That way it only effects the cylinder.  It's like a scope if(1) { }

    glPushMatrix();										// Start a new matrix scope

    glColor3ub(150, 150, 150);

    // We translate the cylinder over by half of it's length so it's centered on the screen

    glTranslatef(-1.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f);				// Move the cylinder over so it's centered around (0, 0, 0)

    // Then we want to rotate it 90 degrees so it is along the X-Axis

    glRotatef(90, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);				// Rotate the cylinder around 90 degrees

    // We can set the draw style the Quadric.  The main options are: (GLU_FILL, GLU_LINE, GLU_POINT)
    // We want to be able to see through the cylinder so we made a global variable that is
    // triggered by the left mouse click to switch back and forth between GLU_FILL and GLU_LINE.
    // The default is GLU_FILL.  We need to pass in the object we wish to effect, then the style.

    gluQuadricDrawStyle(pObj, g_RenderMode);			// Draw the cylinder in lines

    // When we want to draw a Quadric, we just pass it into the desired shape function.
    // Since we want a cylinder, we use the gluCylinder() function.
    // It's parameters are :
    // (The object, the base radius, the top radius, height, definition X, definition Y)
    // The object we pass in holds all the settings.
    // The base radius is the radius of the bottom of the cylinder.
    // The top radius is obviously the radius of the top of the cylinder.
    // The height is how long the cylinder is.
    // The X and Y definition basically tells how many points to create it from.
    // The higher these numbers, the more vertices the cylinder will have.
    // Too much can make it really slow.

    gluCylinder(pObj, 1, 1, 3, 40, 3);				// Draw our cylinder

    glPopMatrix();										// End the scope of the new matrix

    // Now that we popped the last matrix, anything we do here after will effect the sphere.

    // We want to make the sphere move back and forth, so we use glTranslatef() to do that.
    // We give it our current X position, and set the rest to 0.  We will go just along the X-Axis.
    // We then add the speed afterwards, which could be a negative or positive number, depending on directionX.

    glTranslatef(positionX, 0.0f, 0.0f);				// Set the new X position for the sphere
    positionX += directionX;							// Add the speed to the current position

    // Since the cylinder could be in GLU_LINE mode, we just set the sphere explicitly to GLU_FILL.
    // Just because we used another matrix doesn't matter because we are using the same object (pObj).

    gluQuadricDrawStyle(pObj, GLU_FILL);				// Draw the sphere normally

    glColor3ub(255, 255, 0);							// Set the color of the sphere to yellow

    // Now we create a sphere.  We can use the same object if we want since the cylinder is already drawn.
    // The parameters for gluSphere() are:
    // (the object, the sphere's radius, the definition X, the definition Y);
    // These are pretty intuitive, but once again, the definition X and Y
    // effects the amount of vertices the sphere has, the higher the number.

    gluSphere(pObj, 0.5f, 25, 25);						// Draw the sphere with a radius of 0.5

    SwapBuffers(g_hDC);									// Swap the backbuffers to the foreground

    // After the scene has been drawn and we swapped the back buffer to the front,
    // we want to check to see if the sphere needs to turn around.  We just made it
    // go along a X path of -2 to 2.  If it goes past those coordinates, we change directions.

    if(positionX >= 2.0f || positionX <= -2.0f)			// Check if we went past our X-Axis limit
        directionX *= -1;								// Turn the direction the opposite way

    // Since we are done rendering the Quadrics, we can free the object.
    // gluDeleteQuadric() takes the object to be released. If you have a lot
    // of Quadrics, you might not want to allocate and free them every frame.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// In this tutorial we show how to add specular lighting to your objects.
// This is simple to add.  All you need to do is call glMaterialfv() and
// give it the values for GL_SPECULAR and GL_SHININESS.
//
// Once again, the sepcular hilighting is best viewed with a more abstract
// and less rounded object.
//
//
// Let us know if this tutorial helped out, or you have some feedback or questions.

// Good Luck!
