// If you have ever wanted to display only part of an image without having it displayed
// as a rectangle, such as trees, plants, particles and interfaces, this tutorial
// will demonstrate this important technique.  You may have experimented or seen this
// accomplished with blending.  For example:  glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE) with
// blending turned on (glEnable(GL_BLEND)) will take a texture map and blend it with
// the background.  The closer a color is in the texture map to black, the more it
// will disappear.  If the color being blended is black, it will render the color
// behind it instead.  This means you can have a picture of a tree with a black
// background and it will only draw the tree and not the black background surrounding it.
// The problem with this effect is that it makes the tree look transparent/faded.  This
// works fine for particle effects, but if you want the image to be clear and not faded,
// you will want to either use a 32 bit image with an alpha channel or masking.  Masking
// is basically making it so you only draw the part of an image where it's mask image
// has dark colors.  This means you have 2 images, one for the normal picture, and
// another black and white image that holds the mask.  More of this will be explained
// in the code and in the * QUICK NOTES * section at the bottom of this file.  Due
// to the grouping of our tutorials by subject, you might want to check out the
// matrix tutorial that explains glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix() if you are confused.
// Basically, it works just like a matrix scope, that takes the properties of the
// current matrix, but if you change the matrix with any OpenGL functions, then
// pop it off, it does not effect the previous matrix you started with.
//
// To demonstrate masking we will render a scope tunnel with a cross hair.  In between
// the end of the scope we will see our room rendered.  This is where the transparency
// will be.  If you look at the mask bitmap for the cross hair, you will see that this
// area is white, which means it will NOT draw that part of the image when combined
// with the original image.  Only the parts with dark colors will be drawn.  Let's
// go over the controls for this app:
//
// LEFT / RIGHT Arrow Keys or 'a' / 'd' - This rotates the camera's view in a circle
// UP / DOWN Arrow Keys or 'w' / 's' - This makes our scope zoom in and out
// SPACE BAR - This turns night vision on and off
// ESCAPE Key - This quits the program
//
// Besides teaching masking, Ortho mode is also discussed.  Ortho mode allows us
// to use 2D coordinates instead of 3D coordinates.  This is perfect for art that
// needs to stay in front of the screen and never move, such as interface art.
// This is what we do for our scope image, this way it will always be centered on screen.
//
// This tutorial was taken from the original texture mapping tutorial.
//

// This will store if we want night vision on our off (press the space bar)
bool g_bNightVision = false;

// This is our camera rotation degree
float g_rotateY = 0;

// This holds the zoom value of our scope
float g_zoom = 0;

// Here comes the complicated stuff that we don't usually deal with, our projection matrix.
// Basically what is going on with the 2 functions OrthoMode() and PerspectiveMode() is
// we are switching from plotting 3D point to plotting 2D points.  This means that
// instead of giving OpenGL 3D coordinates, in Ortho mode we give it screen pixel coords.
// This is a really useful mode to have because it saves us tons of math when it comes
// to displaying interface art over our 3D screen.  You would have to rotate the
// interface art whenever the camera changes, which could be annoying.  On top of that,
// you need to take into account the depth value, which means you have to find the best
// depth to render the art at.  This can stretch and pixelate the art, making it look bad.
// This is also incredibly faster than doing glDrawPixels(), and you don't have to touch
// the rasterizer, plus you can use blending and other OpenGL effects.

    // to our previous projection matrix, but first we will render in ortho mode.
    //  Next, we load a new identity matrix so that everything is initialize before
    // we go into ortho mode.  One we switch to ortho by calling glOrth(), we then
    // want to set our matrix mode to GL_MODELVIEW, which puts us back and ready to

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Pretty cool effect huh?  Well, you might be puking over the incredible blurred
// scope image.  This is because we are taking a small texture and stretching it
// across the whole screen.  I chose to do a small texture because some video
// cards don't support larger textures than 512.by 512.  The scope looks fine, but
// the cross hair is blurry,  Most likely, the scope image would be blank without a
// cross hair, then we could make a more detailed scope and render it to the center
// of the screen with it's own mask.  If the scope image is currently to big for
// your video card, just go into any paint program and shrink it, then try it.
//
// Let's review once more on some vocabulary:
//
// Masking - This technique allows you to render the shape of an image, instead of
// seeing a rectangle tree for instance.  This is accomplished by creating a mask,
// like in 2D, to blit before the image, then render the transparent texture with a
// one to one blend over top of the mask.  The draw back of masking is that you have
// to render the image twice.  Compiled vertex arrays come in handy for speeding this
// up though.  I suggest maybe trying a 32-bit image with an alpha channel instead.
//
// Ortho Mode - Ortho mode is a projections mode that allows us to draw primitives
// in 2D.  We don't use glVertex3f(), but glVertex2f().  This takes screen coordinates
// instead of 3D unit coordinates.  This is very helpful when dealing with interfaces
// or anything else you want to stay on the screen, no matter what the camera is doing.
//
// So, how is it that we make the image stay in front of the screen no matter where the
// camera's view moves too?  This is quite simple really.  Notice in OrthoMode() that
// we push on a matrix right before we call glLoadIdentity().  We do this so that
// the current matrix we are working with is NOT effected by us reseting a new matrix
// to the identity matrix.  By reseting the matrix, there is NO rotation, scale or
// translations applied to anything rendered afterwards, until we call a glPopMatrix()
// to go back to our original matrix.  So basically, it's as if we said, "Time out,
// I need to start with a fresh matrix, but don't delete my last matrix because I want
// to go back to it in a second".  This has nothing to do with ortho mode, and you
// don't even have to push and pop a new matrix on the stack if you render with your
// reset matrix last.  We just push on a new matrix because we switch to ortho mode
// and want to go back to perspective mode without having to reinitialize it.
//
// This tutorial should give you tons of idea when making your games.  This knowledge
// is vital to making most any 3D game.
//
// Once again, this tutorial allows you to rotate and zoom in/out with your scope.
// There is also a night vision mode.  Here are the keys:
//
// LEFT / RIGHT Arrow Keys or 'a' / 'd' - This rotates the camera's view in a circle
// UP / DOWN Arrow Keys or 'w' / 's' - This makes our scope zoom in and out
// SPACE BAR - This turns night vision on and off
// ESCAPE Key - This quits the program
//
// I hope this helps someone out!
