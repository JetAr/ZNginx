/*	This tutorial will show you how to load a texture map WITHOUT using a bitmap library.

	But first, lets review texture mapping in general:

	You have to "turn on texture mapping" by making the following call:
    glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);

    Next you have to load your texture (in our case a 24 or 32-bit .bmp file) instead of
    using the glaux library (or any other preexisting library) we will do it ourselves.

	Then you call glGenTextures() -- This generates a unique texture reference ID.
	We then call glBindTexture() next to say "Okay this is the texture we are
	currently working with"

	Next up is the loading of the texture.  You do this will a call to:  glTexImage2D().  This
	is what assocaties the pixel bits of the texture with the OpenGL id we binded with
	the previous call to glBindTexture().

	If we have mip-maps we want to create, we'll then call gluBuild2DMipmaps(), this goes through
	and makes every power of 2, counting down, sized mip-map for the texture we just loaded.  So if
	our texture was a 128x128, calling gluBuild2DMipmaps() would generate a 64x64, 32x32, 16x16, 8x8,
	4x4, 2x2, and 1x1 mipmap for that texture.

	Last but not least, we set the "quality" of our texture map with glTexParameteri()
	Depending on what flags we pass in, we can make the texture look really smooth or
	have it render faster but be a bit more pixilated.

	So now we have our textured loaded, we need to AGAIN call glBindTexture() BEFORE drawing
	to say "use this texture when rendering" -- Then we make calls to glTexCoord2f(), this
	tells OpenGL what coordinates on the texture map to start rendering (drawing) from.

	When it's all said and done be sure to free up the memory used by your texture map with
	a call to glDeleteTextures()

/*
	Now you should be a texture mapping guru :)

	So why would you ever not want to use the glaux library???  Well for starters if it
	wasn't available to you, which happens to be the case in Visual Studio 2008 and above,
	and it's good to know how to still load a texture without depending on libraries.  Also by loading
	your own textures you can have a lot more flexibility.  For instance, lets say that we
	wanted to make our texture we loaded darker.  Since we loaded it we could just add a method
	to the CBitmap class that say "subtracted 2" from every RGB value (thus making the
	texture darker) then we could bind it to an OpenGL texture ID.

	Also we can load ANY file format we want (not all file formats are supported by glaux)
	As long as we can load a file into our CBitmap class, we can create a texture from it.

	If you have any questions or comments, send 'em our way on the GT message board found
	at www.gametutorials.com.
