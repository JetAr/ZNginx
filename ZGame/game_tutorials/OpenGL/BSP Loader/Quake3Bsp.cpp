// this first tutorial as simple as possible, we are just going to render the

// will also just be reading in enough to render the basic world data and textures.
// Lightmaps will be added to our walls in the next tutorial.  This is a REALLY
// excellent effect which brings realism to the whole seen.
//
// Be sure to look at the HTML file format that was included with this tutorial.
// It has the whole file format and added information not discussed in this tutorial.

// This tells us if we want to render the textures (used later for just lightmaps)

    // still haven't figured out why they do this, but I imagine

    // image formats without having to use the level editor again.
    // What we do hear is just assume that it's either going to be
    // a jpeg or targa file.  I haven't seen any other type
    // be used.  If you just add on either one of those extensions
    // to the current name and see if a file with that name exits,
    // then it must be the texture extension.  If fopen() returns
    // a NULL, there is no file with that name.  Keep in mind that

    // you won't be able to load them unless you try and read from their
    // pk3 files if the texture isn't found in the level's .pk3 file.

    // in the shader.  So, don't be surprised if not all the textures are loaded.

    //
    // The .bsp file format stores the data in lumps.  Look at the

    // is just like a chunk like in binary formats such as .3ds.

    // offset for each lump and read in it's data.  To find out how many
    // structures instances the lump has, you just divide the lump's
    // length by the sizeof(<theStructure>).  Check out the HTML file for
    // more detail on this.  The only one that is handled a bit differently
    // is the visibility lump.  There is only one of these for the .bsp file.

    // you can sometimes draw double the faces that you need to.  In this first
    // tutorial we draw every face once, so it doesn't matter, but when we get
    // into leafs we will need this.  I just chose to add it in the beginning
    // so I don't cram a ton of code down your throat when we get to the

    // First, we need to give OpenGL a pointer to our first vertice.
    // We also tell OpenGL that there is 3 floats, and the offset between
    // each vertices is the size of tBSPVertex in bytes.  That way we don't have

    // to our indices, but it's not a normal indice array.  The indices are stored
    // according to the pFace->startVertIndex into the vertices array.  If you were
    // to print all of our indices out, they wouldn't go above the number 5.  If there
    // is over 70 vertices though, how is that possible for the indices to work?  Well,
    // that is why we give our vertex array functions above a pointer to the startVertIndex,
    // then the indice array acts according to that.  This is very important to do it this
    // way, otherwise we will not get more than 5 vertices display, and for all our faces.

    // We are going to draw triangles, pass in the number of indices for this face, then
    // say the indices are stored as ints, then pass in the starting address in our indice

// Pretty easy to grasp isn't it?  We didn't do much in this tutorial, but we
// got the basics down, and once you have those, the rest is easy.  The next
// tutorial will implement light maps.  The level looks pretty boring without
// any lighting.
//
// Remember to refer back to the HTML file that comes with this tutorial to
// learn more about the file format.  I skipped a bunch of information because
// it's already in that file.

// Let me know what you think of this tutorial, I would love to hear your
