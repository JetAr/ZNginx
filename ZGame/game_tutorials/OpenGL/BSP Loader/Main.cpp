// The code base for this tutorial was primarily taken from the Time Based Movement
// tutorial.  This tutorial is the first in a series that will show you how to
// load Quake3 .bsp files.  In this version we will just focus on loading the faces
// and the textures.  The next tutorial will show how to apply lightmaps to our level.
//
// What is a .bsp file?  Quake3 uses the .bsp file format (IBSP) to load its level data.
// Quake3 levels are stored in .pk3 files, which are just .zip files renamed.  You can
// rename them to .zip files and unzip them to get at it's data.  In tutorial, except
// near the end, we will not be reading from a zip file, but from the unzipped version.
// This is because it's a ton of code to read from a zip file and that isn't the point
// of the beginning tutorials.
//
// * IMPORTANT *
//
// This tutorial series in not intended to recreate Quake3.  The whole point of this
// is to introduce you to game level formats so that you can use their tools to create
// your own games, and/or to get a good idea on how to create your own level format.
// Here is a list of the topics that I will be covering in the series:
//
// - Normal level geometry with textures
// - Multi-texturing with lightmaps
// - Basic entity parsing
// - Drawing with nodes and leafs
// - Frustum Culling and PVS (Portals|Clusters) handling
// - Basic shader parsing
// - Reading from the .pk3 file (.zip file)
// - Collision detection with brushes
//
// Anything more than that I probably won't do right away.  I intend to gradually
// add more to this over time possibly, but I don't want to just focus on Quake stuff.
// There are tons of other tutorials to write :)  If you guys want to add on to our
// tutorials and submit them to us, that would be AWESOME.
//
// Building a 3D game from scratch is pretty hard.  With these tutorials I hope this
// will help you to avoid having to write your own level editor from scratch, since
// you can just use q3Radiant and other tools that ID provides free that create .bsp files.
// In case you are wondering, I won't be going over how to use the level editor, except
// the basics on how to compile your .bsp file.  There are too many tutorials on the tools
// already out there, plus it's so complex I would never get around to other tutorials.
//
// * HTML COMPANION *
//
// Be sure to read the HTML file that should come with this tutorial.  This explains a
// bunch about the .bsp file format.  I won't be going into a huge amount of detail in
// the comments because much of it is talked about and shown in the HTML file.
//
// * NEWBIE WARNING *
//
// I would like to point out that though you might be able to understand everything
// in this tutorial, this is not a newbie tutorial on how to render a game level.  It
// is assumed that you have at LEAST loaded other types of file formats such as .3ds,
// .ase, .obj, .md2, .md3, or any others.  In order to create this series fast enough,
// I can't expound on every concept.  If you don't understand much of what is done here,
// first try loading in other file formats.
//
// I might add, that I will not be doing the best optimizations possible for the
// rendering, so I don't confused the usage of the data, but I will discuss at the end
// on how you can get the best speed possible.  On a large level I get on average of
// 150 fps to 200 fps in most areas on a Geforce2 64mb.  If I put in the extra
// optimizations I should be getting around an average of 250 fps.
//
// I also want to mention is that I started the tutorial with a tiny 1 room
// level because it's always a good idea to start with something super small when
// learning to load in data from a file format.  That way it's reasonable to debug it
// if something goes wrong.  Probably about the third tutorial we will use a large level.
// If you decide to go and get a .bsp file somewhere else, you might find that not all
// of the textures load.  This is because many levels used the textures that came with
// the original game.  Quake searches for the texture and if it doesn't find it, it will
// search the rest of the base .pk3 files for the correct texture.  Sometimes you will
// also find that the texture isn't named the same as the file name.  To get around this
// you can just check with a strstr() to see if the texture is in part of the file name.
// To get other missing textures to load, you will sometimes need to get the file name
// from the shader files.
//
// Since there isn't a ton of information about the .bsp file format around, other than
// some huge engines and such, I did the best I could to get all the information fast so
// I could create this series.  If there is anything wrong or missing from my descriptions,
// please let me know so that I can correct it.
//

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Pretty easy to grasp isn't it?  We didn't do much in this tutorial, but we
// got the basics down, and once you have those, the rest is easy.  The next
// tutorial will implement light maps.  The level looks pretty boring without
// any lighting.
//
// The controls for this tutorial are:
//
// w, s, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW - Move the camera forward and backward
// a, d, RIGHT_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW - Strafe the camera left and right
// Mouse movement - Moves the view for first person mode
// Right Mouse Button - Turns textures on and off
// Space Bar - Turns wireframe on and off
// ESCAPE - Quits the program
//
// Remember to refer back to the HTML file that comes with this tutorial to
// learn more about the file format.  I skipped a bunch of information because
// it's already in that file.
//
// Be sure to include to correct libraries listed at the top and in the read me.
//
// Let me know what you think of this tutorial, I would love to hear your
// feedback and any cool projects you create with it.
//
// Enjoy!
