// This tutorial branches off the last tutorial on fonts.  If you are not familiar
// with display lists, this concept is taught more in-depth in the previous tutorial
// entitled "FONTS".  The difference from this tutorial and the last is that we will
// be able to create 3D fonts that can be rotated, translated and scaled, where as
// before we had to just leave them at the front of the screen with no options but color.
// Depending on what you want a font for, you will want to use either one of these tutorials.

// This is an unsigned int (since we can't have a negative base pointer) that will hold
// the ID for our display list.  It isn't so much of an ID, but it's easier to think of it
// that way.  When we create a display list, we start at 1.  If we create another one we
// then move the list pointer to 2.  g_FontListID holds the BASE number for the display list.
// We are going to create 256 lists for all the characters, so we will start at one,
// and the list pointer will then be at 257 if you create another list.  When using display
// lists, we need the base pointer to tell OpenGL which list number we are starting at.
// This will make more sense in the functions below.
UINT g_FontListID = 0;

// This will save our old font and select it back in at the end of our program.
// We need this because we use SelectObject() to select in the new font.
// We don't want any memory leaks :)
HFONT hOldFont;

// This define is for the amount of lists we want to create.  There will need to be 1
// for every character.  Since there are 256 ASCII characters, we will use 256.
// If we only wanted certain characters used, like alpha numerics, we would give less.

    // other options out, but feel free to add them to your function (like bold, italic, width..)

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Now we can actually have cool looking 3D text!  I think I might have over complicated
// this tutorial, but I feel that you should know as much as possible when it comes to
// such a magical subject as 3D text.  A lot of the work is done for you, so you don't
// also know what is left for you to do.  In the last tutorial you could just display
// text in 2D, but now you can actually work with a 3D object.  In 3D studio max and other
// software packages, you can create 3D text with fonts.  That means you are one step
// closer to making your own 3D software :-)
//
// An easy way to make a tunnel would be to make a font with a huge extrude value
// and then print out a 'O'.  Either that or do a quadric cylinder.
//
// The only thing really different from Bitmap Fonts and 3D fonts is:
//
// wglUseFontOutlines() verses wglUseFontBitmaps()
//
// Most of the rest of the stuff is the same, except you position the differently.
// With bitmaps you use the glRasterPos*() functions, and with 3D objects you position
// them normally, like every other object with glTranslatef().
//
// I would like once again to thank Nehe (nehe.gamedev.net) for the ideas.
// I hope this tutorial helped someone out.  Let us know if you ever use it.
