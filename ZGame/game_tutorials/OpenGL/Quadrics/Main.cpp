    // To use Quadrics, we need to create a new one first.  This is done below.
    // The GLUquadricObj type is defined with the GLU32 library and associated header file.

    GLUquadricObj *pObj = gluNewQuadric();				// Get a Quadric off the stack

    // Instead of generating the U V coordinates of a Quadric, it does it for us.
    // This is REALLY helpful and easy to work with.  We need to tell OpenGL that we intend
    // for it to turn on texturing for our particular Quadric.  All we need to do this is
    // pass in our object, and then a "true" which says we want texturing.

    gluQuadricTexture(pObj, true);						// This turns on texture coordinates for our Quadric

    // Below we rotate both of the Quadrics along the X-Axis.
    // This gives them that spining effect.

    glRotatef(rotateX, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);				// Make the Quadrics spin along the X axis
    rotateX += 0.2f;									// Increase the rotation

    // Since a cylinder is created going down the Z axis, we want to rotate
    // it so it is going down the X axis.  This way the sphere can go through it.
    // We don't want to translate and rotate the sphere, so we use another matrix to
    // do this stuff.  That way it only effects the cylinder.  It's like a scope if(1) { }

    glPushMatrix();										// Start a new matrix scope

    // We translate the cylinder over by half of it's length so it's centered on the screen

    glTranslatef(-1.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f);				// Move the cylinder over so it's centered around (0, 0, 0)

    // Then we want to rotate it 90 degrees so it is along the X-Axis

    glRotatef(90, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);				// Rotate the cylinder around 90 degrees

    // We can set the draw style the Quadric.  The main options are: (GLU_FILL, GLU_LINE, GLU_POINT)
    // We want to be able to see through the cylinder so we made a global variable that is
    // triggered by the left mouse click to switch back and forth between GLU_FILL and GLU_LINE.
    // The default is GLU_FILL.  We need to pass in the object we wish to effect, then the style.

    gluQuadricDrawStyle(pObj, g_RenderMode);			// Draw the cylinder in lines

    // When we want to draw a Quadric, we just pass it into the desired shape function.
    // Since we want a cylinder, we use the gluCylinder() function.
    // It's parameters are :
    // (The object, the base radius, the top radius, height, definition X, definition Y)
    // The object we pass in holds all the settings.
    // The base radius is the radius of the bottom of the cylinder.
    // The top radius is obviously the radius of the top of the cylinder.
    // The height is how long the cylinder is.
    // The X and Y definition basically tells how many points to create it from.
    // The higher these numbers, the more vertices the cylinder will have.
    // Too much can make it really slow.

    gluCylinder(pObj, 1, 1, 3, 20, 20);				// Draw our cylinder

    glPopMatrix();										// End the scope of the new matrix

    // Now that we popped the last matrix, anything we do here after will effect the sphere.

    // We want to make the sphere move back and forth, so we use glTranslatef() to do that.
    // We give it our current X position, and set the rest to 0.  We will go just along the X-Axis.
    // We then add the speed afterwards, which could be a negative or positive number, depending on directionX.

    glTranslatef(positionX, 0.0f, 0.0f);				// Set the new X position for the sphere
    positionX += directionX;							// Add the speed to the current position

    // Since the cylinder could be in GLU_LINE mode, we just set the sphere explicitly to GLU_FILL.
    // Just because we used another matrix doesn't matter because we are using the same object (pObj).

    gluQuadricDrawStyle(pObj, GLU_FILL);				// Draw the sphere normally

    // Now we create a sphere.  We can use the same object if we want since the cylinder is already drawn.
    // The parameters for gluSphere() are:
    // (the object, the sphere's radius, the definition X, the definition Y);
    // These are pretty intuitive, but once again, the definition X and Y
    // effects the amount of vertices the sphere has, the higher the number.

    gluSphere(pObj, 0.5f, 20, 20);						// Draw the sphere with a radius of 0.5

    SwapBuffers(g_hDC);									// Swap the backbuffers to the foreground

    // After the scene has been drawn and we swapped the back buffer to the front,
    // we want to check to see if the sphere needs to turn around.  We just made it
    // go along a X path of -2 to 2.  If it goes past those coordinates, we change directions.

    if(positionX >= 2.0f || positionX <= -2.0f)			// Check if we went past our X-Axis limit
        directionX *= -1;								// Turn the direction the opposite way

    // Since we are done rendering the Quadrics, we can free the object.
    // gluDeleteQuadric() takes the object to be released. If you have a lot
    // of Quadrics, you might not want to allocate and free them every frame.

    gluDeleteQuadric(pObj);								// Free the Quadric

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial was built from the texture map tutorial, so make sure you understand
// the texturing tutorial before you take this on.
//
// * So what the heck is a Quadric ??!?!??  *
//
// A quadric is basically a data type that allows you to draw a sphere and cylinder
// really simply.  It comes from the GLU library.  They are great for texturing and
// lighting without having to work with the UV coordinates or the normals.
//
// Quadrics are simple aren't they?  That is what makes them great, they are easy
// to use and easy to create.  They can also create their own normals for lighting.
// Check out the gluQuadricNormals() function for more information.
//
// Here is a quick overview of Quadrics:
//
// 1) To create a Quadric, you need to first allocate one from the stack.
//    To do this, you call the gluNewQuadric() function.  This returns a pointer
//    to a GLUquadricObj.  You will then use the GLUquadricObj to pass into Quadric
//    functions() so you can set the properties of that object.
//
// 2) Next, you can just start drawing them by calling 1 of the 2 functions:
//    gluSphere() and gluCylinder().  Read in RenderScene() for more info on those.
//
// 3) Before you render the Quadrics, you can change their draw style by calling:
//    gluDrawDStyle().  Some options include GLU_LINE GLU_POINT and GLU_FILL.
//    If you want the object to be texture mapped, after you call glBindTexture(),
//    called gluQuadricTexture() and pass in the object, then pass in true.
//    Make sure you do this BEFORE you call the gluSphere() or gluCylinder() functions.
//
// That's it!  They are drawn from the origin, so you will have to move them around with
// glRotatef() and glTranslate()/
//
// Let us know if this tutorial helped out, or you have some feedback or questions.
//
// Good Luck!
