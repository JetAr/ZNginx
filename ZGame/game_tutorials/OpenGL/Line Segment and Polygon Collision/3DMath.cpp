//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// WOW!  That is a lot of math for one day.  The good thing about this is that you
// don't have to code it over again (except when you write tutorials :)  ).
// Now that you have these functions, you can use them and very rarely tweak them.
// This code is probably not the most optimized, but it works pretty good.
// Let us know if you find some good optimizations though.  I am always trying
// to make my code faster in any way possible.  There are a few things I see
// but I didn't want to implement because it would complicate the tutorial.
//
// So, do you feel comfortable with this stuff?  At least enough to use the functions?
// The next tutorial will take this information and incorporate it into sphere collision.
// Sphere collision is wonderful.  It is easy, and it's very intuitive: If you go in my
// sphere, you collided!  You just need a radius and that's it.  No more complicated math.
//
// This tutorial should give you enough to write your own simple collision routines.
// One might include making a simple maze and then checking collision with your view
// vector and position against all the maze walls.  This would be incredibly simple.
// just pass in your position and view and test against each polygon in the maze.
//
// Later you can learn about space partitioning, but with a small maze it won't matter.
//
// Let's go over the material once more in a brief overview.
//
// 1) Once you find out that the line and the plane intersect, you need to get the intersection
//    point.  In order to get the intersection point, we needed to learn about the dot product.
//    The basic premise of getting the intersection point is finding the distant from a point on
//    the line, either end is fine, then moving from that point along the lines vector.  But,
//    we can't just directly move across that distance, because that is the distance from the plane,
//    it doesn't mean that it's the actual point of intersection.  Take the case that the line is
//    almost parallel with the plane, but is slightly tilted so it intersects a ways down.  Well,
//    the distance from the plane would be very short, where the distance to the intersection point
//    is considerably longer.  To solve this problem, we divide the negated distance by the dot product
//    of the normal and the lines vector.  This then gives us the correct distant to the intersection point.
//
// 2) Once we find the intersection point, we need to test if that point is inside of the polygon.
//    just because we collide with the plane, doesn't mean that we collided with the polygon.
//	  Planes are infinite, so the polygon could be hundred of coordinate units from us.  To test
//    to see if we are inside of the polygon, we create vectors from the intersection point to
//    each vertex of the polygon.  Then, as we do this, we calculate the angle between the vectors.
//    We create 2 vectors at a time, which then create a triangle.  We only care about the inner angle.
//    After we are finished adding up the angles between each vector of the polygon, if the angles
//    add up to 360 degrees, then the point is inside of the polygon.  We create a function called
//    AngleBetweenVectors() which gives us the angle between 2 vectors in radians.  So the angles
//    need to add up to at least 2 * PI.  To get the angle between 2 vectors we found out that
//    if we use this equation (V . W / || V || * || W || ) which is the dot product between
//    vector V and vector W, divided by the magnitude of vector V multiplied by the magnitude of vector W.
//    We then take the arc cosine of that result and it gives us the angle in radians.  If we
//    are working with unit vectors (vectors that are normalized with length of 1) we don't need
//    to do the || V || * || W || part of the equation because it gets canceled out from the dot product.
//
// 3) After we coded those last 2 steps, we put them into a usable function called IntersectedPolygon().
//    It's simple to use, just pass in an array that makes up the polygon, pass in the line array,
//    then the vertex count of the polygon.
