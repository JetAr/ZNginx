//  This tutorial is built from the "PlaneCollision" tutorial.  Instead of just
//  colliding with a plane, we now can do better collision that checks the whole polygon.
//  You wouldn't do much yet with just plane collision, but now you can actually make
//  somewhat of a decent maze or what ever you want.  There is a lot of math explained
//  in this tutorial, but hopefully it is explained enough so you understand what is going
//  on.  In the next tutorials it will be further explained, as well as online papers will
//  be written with pictures to give a better illustration.  We didn't change much in this file.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// In this file we just replaced the call to IntersectedPlane() with IntersectedPolygon()
// and allowed the user to use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to further move around the triangle.
// This gives you more ways to test the polygon intersection.
// Now the triangle can move along the Y axis by using PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN.
//
// Let's go over the material once more in a brief overview. (Explained more in 3DMath.h)
//
// 1) Once you find out that the line and the plane intersect, you need to get the intersection
//    point.  In order to get the intersection point, we needed to learn about the dot product.
//    The basic premis of getting the intersection point is finding the distant from a point on
//    the line, either end is fine, then moving from that point along the lines vector.  But,
//    we can't just directly move across that distance, because that is the distance from the plane,
//    it doesn't mean that it's the actual point of intersection.  Take the case that the line is
//    almost parallel with the plane, but is slightly tilted so it intersects a ways down.  Well,
//    the distance from the plane would be very short, where the distance to the intersection point
//    is considerably longer.  To solve this problem, we divide the negated distance by the dot product
//    of the normal and the lines vector.  This then gives us the correct distant to the intersection point.
//
// 2) Once we find the intersection point, we need to test if that point is inside of the polygon.
//    just because we collide with the plane, doesn't mean that we collided with the polygon.
//	  Planes are infinate, so the polygon could be hundred of coordinate units from us.  To test
//    to see if we are inside of the polygon, we create vectors from the intersection point to
//    each vertice of the polygon.  Then, as we do this, we calculate the angle between the vectors.
//    We create 2 vectors at a time, which then create a triangle.  We only care about the inner angle.
//    After we are finished adding up the angles between each vector of the polygon, if the angles
//    add up to 360 degrees, then the point is inside of the polygon.  We create a function called
//    AngleBetweenVectors() which gives us the angle between 2 vectors in radians.  So the angles
//    need to add up to at least 2 * PI.  To get the angle between 2 vectors we found out that
//    if we use this equation (V . W / || V || * || W || ) which is the dot product between
//    vector V and vector W, divided by the magnitude of vector V multiplied by the magnitude of vector W.
//    We then take the arc cosine of that result and it gives us the angle in radians.  If we
//    are working with unit vectors (vectors that are normalized with length of 1) we don't need
//    to do the || V || * || W || part of the equation, but that is the TRUE dot product equation.
//
// 3) After we coded those last 2 steps, we put them into a usable function called IntersectedPolygon().
//    It's simple to use, just pass in an array that makes up the polygon, pass in the line array,
//    then the vertice count of the polygon.
