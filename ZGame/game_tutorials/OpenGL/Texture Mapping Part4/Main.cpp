// This tutorial works off of the original texture mapping tutorial that used
// the glaux library to load bitmaps.  We change very little code to enable
// us to create texture maps from targa (TGA) files.  Take a look down at
// the *Quick Notes* section near the bottom of this page to get more information.
// The targa loader supports 16, 24 and 32-bit images, along with RLE compression.
// The texture loading in this tutorial happens to be a 24-bit image.
//
// It's important to keep in mind that the TGA code is not robust and still needs
// some work before added to an engine, but it should be a great start.  I would
// recommend that you add more error checking and any other TGA formats we are missing.
// It would also need to be moved into a nice class.  I didn't because of simplicity's sake.
//
// It should be understood that I don't intend to go into a huge explanation of the
// TGA file format, since we already have a great tutorial on this in our win32 section
// on our website.  If you are confused with how TGA files are constructed, read it.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// There you have it!  That is how to texture map with targa files.  It's pretty easy.
// All you really care about is that you need to use the function:
//
// tImageTGA *LoadTGA(const char *filename);
//
// This will return a pointer to the TGA information.  Be sure to free the pointer
// and the pixel "data" after you are done with it, just like the aux* bitmap function.
//
// Thought this targa loader isn't robust, you can still load 16, 24 and 32-bit images.
// There is even added support for RLE compressed images, which generally aren't used.
// Our image that we load is 24-bit.
//
// Here is the tImageTGA structure that I created to store the important data:
//
// struct tImageTGA
// {
//	  int channels;			// The channels of the image
//	  int sizeX;			// The width in pixels for the image
//	  int sizeY;			// The height in pixels for the image
//	  unsigned char *data;	// The pixel data for the image
// };
//
//
// As a review, here are the steps to texture mapping:
//
// 1) Turn on texture mapping by saying:
//
//	  glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
//
//    This is usually done in the beginning of the program.  BUT, you will
//    want to turn it back off before you draw primitives using color instead.
//    So, say:  glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)  - Then draw your colored shapes, then
//    turn it back on by saying glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
//
// 2) Load a texture.  Once you have the data of the texture you loaded, you need to
//    register it with OpenGL.  The first step to do this is:
//
//	  glGenTextures(1, &textureArray[textureID]);
//
//    This generates a unique texture reference to the desired index of our texture array.
//	  We then pass this data into glBindTexture() to set the current texture being mapped.
//
//	  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureArray[textureID]);
//
//    We NEED to call glBindTexture() after we generate the texture using glGenTextures,
//    otherwise it won't be assigned the data from the next function, gluBuild2DMipmaps();
//
//	  gluBuild2DMipmaps(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 3, pImage->sizeX, pImage->sizeY, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pImage->data);
//
//    What is a mip map you ask?  Mip maps are a bunch of different scaled sizes of the texture.
//    The reason for this is because it makes the texture look nicer if we are farther away or
//    up close to the texture.  It picks the best size depending on the distance we are from it.
//    It is a good idea to make textures that are a power of 2, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc...
//    This makes it so it can get a smoother representation when it scales, otherwise it could look worse when scaled.
//    After we build the mip maps, we then need to set the type of filter we want to use.
//
//	  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,GL_LINEAR);
//	  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,GL_LINEAR);
//
//    If we use GL_LINEAR it will look smoother, but takes a little speed hit.  If we use
//    GL_NEAREST it will be a bit faster, but will look pixilated and blotchy.  The MIN filter
//    is used whenever the pixel being textured maps to an area greater than one texture element.
//    The MAX filter is used when the pixel being textured maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element
//
// 3) After we load the texture, we just need to call glBindTexture() to set that as the current
//    texture being mapped.
//
// 4) Next, we need to give each vertex a texture coordinate, also called (U, V) coordinates.
//    We do that by calling:
//
//    glTexCoord2f(U, V);
//
//    This assigns a part of the image to the next vertice passed in.  It's like putting a
//    sticker on paper, you just match the correct corner with the correct paper corner.
//    You have to be careful when you do this or else the image will be flipped or upside down.
//    It depends on the direction of your camera though.  The order is VERY important.
//
// 5) Lastly, you need to delete the textures after you are finished.  You do this by calling:
//
//    glDeleteTextures(1, &textureArray[textureIndex]);
//
// That's it!  Let us know at GameTutorials.com if this tutorial helps you.  We would love to
// see what you come up with.
