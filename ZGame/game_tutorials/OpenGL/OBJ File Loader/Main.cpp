// This tutorial will demonstrate how to load a .OBJ file.  This 3D file format
// was originally created from Maya by Alias|Wavefront.  It can be exported into most
// other programs.  A great tool for converting 3D file formats is "3D Exploration".
// This is a shareware utility that can be found for download on the web.
// This OBJ loader loads the vertices, the faces, and the texture UV coordinates.
// Since .obj files don't have material information I created my own to manually add textures/colors.
// In this tutorial, there is a picture of a face rotating around.  It is a single object
// This loader can load multiple objects, like the .3DS tutorial we have on our site.
// Below are the controls to this application:

// Left Mouse Button - Changes the Render mode from normal to wire frame.
// Right Mouse Button - Turns lighting On/Off
// Left Arrow Key - Spins the model to the left
// Right Arrow Key - Spins the model to the right
// Escape - Quits

#define FILE_NAME  "foot.obj"							// This is the 3D file we will load.

UINT g_Texture[MAX_TEXTURES] = {0};						// This holds the texture info, referenced by an ID

CLoadObj g_LoadObj;										// This is OBJ class.  This should go in a good model class.
t3DModel g_3DModel;										// This holds the 3D Model info that we load in

int   g_ViewMode	  = GL_TRIANGLES;					// We want the default drawing mode to be normal
bool  g_bLighting     = true;							// Turn lighting on initially
float g_RotateX		  = 0.0f;							// This is the current value at which the model is rotated
float g_RotationSpeed = 0.8f;							// This is the speed that our model rotates.  (-speed rotates left)

    // To render the current object, we go through all of it's faces (Polygons).
    // What is a face you ask?  A face is just (in this case) a triangle of the object.
    // For instance, a cube has 12 faces because each side has 2 triangles.
    // You might be thinking.  Well, if there are 12 faces in a cube, that makes
    // 36 vertices that we needed to read in for that object.  Not really true.  Because
    // a lot of the vertices are the same, since they share sides, they only need to save
    // 8 vertices, and ignore the duplicates.  Then, you have an array of all the
    // unique vertices in that object.  No 2 vertices will be the same.  This cuts down
    // on memory.  Then, another array is saved, which is the index numbers for each face,
    // which index in to that array of vertices.  That might sound silly, but it is better
    // than saving tons of duplicate vertices.  The same thing happens for UV coordinates.
    // You don't save duplicate UV coordinates, you just save the unique ones, then an array
    // that index's into them.  This might be confusing, but most 3D files use this format.
    // This loop below will stay the same for most file formats that you load, so all you need

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load an .obj file.  These files are ASCII text files
// that contain very few information about the models, but are great for importing/exporting
// into almost every 3D software package as well as being easy to read in.
//
// This tutorial is modified from the 3DS loading tutorial.  I wanted to keep them
// consistent as possible so you didn't have to see much changed between the 2.
// The failure in that is that .obj files don't have material information, so I had
// to add my own manual ways of doing it.  I personally wouldn't use .obj for a demo
// or game, but It is always great to have something like this around since it's so
// popular.  I would recommend looking at this tutorial actually before the 3DS tutorial.
//
// * What's An STL (Standard Template Library) Vector? *
// Let me quickly explain the STL vector for those of you who are not familiar with them.
// To use a vector you must include <vector> and use the std namespace: using namespace std;
// A vector is an array based link list.  It allows you to dynamically add and remove nodes.
// This is a template class so it can be a list of ANY type.  To create a vector of type
// "int" you would say:  vector<int> myIntList;
// Now you can add a integer to the dynamic array by saying: myIntList.push_back(10);
// or you can say:  myIntList.push_back(num);.  The more you push back, the larger
// your array gets.  You can index the vector like an array.  myIntList[0] = 0;
// To get rid of a node you use the pop_back() function.  To clear the vector use clear().
// It frees itself so you don't need to worry about it, except if you have data
// structures that need information freed from inside them, like our objects.
//
// Here is some commentary about the .obj file which comes from the bottom of obj.cpp:
//
// First, no .obj file format is going to be the same.  When you import/export
// .obj files anywhere, each application has their own way of saving it.  Some
// save normals, some save extra comments, some save object names, etc...  That is
// why I calculate my own normals because rarely are they including as "vn" in the file.
// The only thing you can depend on is the headers:
//
// "v"  - This is a line that contains a vertex (x y z)
//
//		IE:			v	-1	-1	0
//
// After the 'v' it will list the X Y and Z information for that vertex.
//
// "vt" - This is a line that contains a UV texture coordinate (U V)
//
//		IE:			vt	.99998	.99936
//
// After the "vt" it will list the U and V information for a vertex.
// Note that this will ONLY appear in the file if the object has a UVW map.
// Just dragging a texture onto an object doesn't create a UVW map.
//
// "f"	- This is a line that contains the vertex indices into the vertex array.
//        If there are UV coordinates for that object, it also contains the UV indices.
//
//		IE (Just vertices):			f	1	2	3
//
//		IE (Verts and UV Indices)	f	1/1 2/2	3/3
//
// After the 'f' it will list the vertex indices, or the vertex / UV indices.
//
// Those are the only 3 you can count on 99% of the time.  The other one that
// isn't always there is "vn".  That is a vertex normal:  vn -1 0 0
// There are some other lines that are sometimes used by they can be generally ignored.
//
//
// Let us know if this helps you out!
