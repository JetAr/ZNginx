// This class can be used to load a .Obj file.  You will need the grab the
// structures in main.h as well if you want to use this, or create your own.
// I added a couple functions at the end of this class to help with the material
// problem that a .obj file has.  Obj files do not save material information, like
// the color, material name or the texture map file assigned to it.  Though the .obj
// file format isn't the best used for games, I thought I would help out a little.
// To be honest, it would be better to just add the information to the .obj and
// modify my code to read it in.  For instance, put a : c 255 0 255   for the color.

// This is our class for loading .obj files
class CLoadObj
{

public:

    // This will be the only function that needs to be called by you.
    // Just pass in your model that will hold the information and the file name.
    bool ImportObj(t3DModel *pModel, char *strFileName);

    // This is the main loading loop that gets called in ImportObj()
    void ReadObjFile(t3DModel *pModel);

    // This is called in ReadObjFile() if we find a line starting with 'v'
    void ReadVertexInfo();

    // This is called in ReadObjFile() if we find a line starting with 'f'
    void ReadFaceInfo();

    // This is called when we are finished loading in the face information
    void FillInObjectInfo(t3DModel *pModel);

    // This isn't necessary for the loader, but it's nice to have vertex normals for lighting
    void ComputeNormals(t3DModel *pModel);

    // Since .obj files don't have texture/material names, we create a function to set them manually.
    // The materialID is the index into the pMaterial array for our model.
    void SetObjectMaterial(t3DModel *pModel, int whichObject, int materialID);

    // To make it easier to assign a material to a .obj object we create a funtion to do so.
    // We can pass in the model, the material name, the texture file name and the RGB colors.
    // If we just want a color, pass in NULL for strFile.
    void AddMaterial(t3DModel *pModel, char *strName, char *strFile,
                     int r = 255,      int g = 255,   int b = 255);

private:

    // This holds our file pointer for reading in the file
    FILE *m_FilePointer;

    vector<CVector3>  m_pVertices;

    vector<tFace> m_pFaces;

    // This is an STL (Standard Template Library) vector that holds a list of UV Coordinates
    vector<CVector2>  m_pTextureCoords;

    // This tells us if the current object has texture coordinates
    bool m_bObjectHasUV;

    // This tells us if we just read in face data so we can keep track of multiple objects
    bool m_bJustReadAFace;
