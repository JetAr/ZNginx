    // usually the last frame for the standing animation, so it would look like:

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// I bet this is a lot simpler than you imagined eh?  That is the beauty of the
// Quake2 model format, it's so easy to read in.  No crazy chucks to siphon through.
// The only challenge is to think of a way to efficiently parse the animations out.
// That is, if you don't use constants for the standards set on www.planetquake.com.
// You can find that info at:
//
// http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/resources/quake2/q2frameslist.shtml
//
// All that we really changed from the last tutorial was adding a loop to
// read in the frames, instead of just storing first frame.  The ParseAnimations()
// function was also added to step through each of the frames and store off the
// animation names, animation count, and first and last frame for each animation.
//
// You might take note that in the last tutorial we calculated the face normals of our
// model, but on second thought, I decided to not do it in our final MD2 tutorial because
// the model's texture maps are created for their own lighting and just make it darker
// than usual.  Quake2 and many other older games don't use dynamic lighting because it was
// slow on many video cards at the time.
//
// If you go to Main.cpp you will see how to actually interpolate between these
// key frames.  Make sure you understand that these are NOT all the frames of
// animation, but key frames to be blended together through interpolation.  More
// on these topics will be discussed in Main.cpp.
//
// I would once again like to thank Daniel E. Schoenblum <dansch@hops.cs.jhu.edu>
// for help with explaining the file format.
