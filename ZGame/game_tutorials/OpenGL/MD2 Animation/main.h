// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This file includes all the structures that you need to hold the model data
// and animate using key frame interpolation.  If you intend to add to this code, I would
// make the model and object structures classes. This way you can have a bunch of
// helper functions like Import(), Translate(), Render()...
//
// This file added a new structure since the last Quake MD2 loading tutorial, tAnimationInfo:
//
// struct tAnimationInfo
// {
//	  char strName[255];	// This stores the name of the animation (Jump, Pain, etc..)
//	  int startFrame;		// This stores the first frame number for this animation
//	  int endFrame;			// This stores the last frame number for this animation
// };
//
// Each quake animation has a character string name, and a starting frame and ending
// frame, of the total ~198 frames of animation in the model.  This makes it easy to
// know where the animation starts and when it stops.  That way our interpolation
// just happens between those frames.  The nice thing about key frame interpolation is
// that if you need to move to another animation, you just interpolate you current frame
// of animation to the first frame of the new animation.  There will usually be a nice
// transition between animations.
//
// We finally added some variables to keep track of our animations and to store
// the current animation and frame our model is in.  These are store in the
// t3DModel structure:
//
//	int numOfAnimations;				// The number of animations in this model (NEW)
//	int currentAnim;					// The current index into pAnimations list (NEW)
//	int currentFrame;					// The current frame of the current animation (NEW)
//	vector<tAnimationInfo> pAnimations; // The list of animations (NEW)
//
// Like the rest of our lists, we make the animation list a STL vector so we don't have
// to write our own list code and worry about clean up.
//
// * What's An STL (Standard Template Library) Vector? *
//
// Let me quickly explain the STL vector for those of you who are not familiar with them.
// To use a vector you must include <vector> and use the std namespace: using namespace std;
// A vector is an array based link list.  It allows you to dynamically add and remove nodes.
// This is a template class so it can be a list of ANY type.  To create a vector of type
// "int" you would say:  vector<int> myIntList;
// Now you can add an integer to the dynamic array by saying: myIntList.push_back(10);
// or you can say:  myIntList.push_back(num);.  The more you push back, the larger
// your array gets.  You can index the vector like an array.  myIntList[0] = 0;
// To get rid of a node you use the pop_back() function.  To clear the vector use clear().
// It frees itself so you don't need to worry about it, except if you have data
// structures that need information freed from inside them, like our objects.
