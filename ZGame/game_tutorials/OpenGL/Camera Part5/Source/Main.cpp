In this tutorial we added a way for the camera to strafe left and right with the A/D or
LEFT/RIGHT keys.  This completes our camera class for now since you should have most of the
basic things that you need to have decent movement in your 3D scene from a first person
perspective.  Another thing you might want to add is of course a jump function.  Look for this
in a future tutorial.

*What is strafing?*
Strafing is when the camera is looking forward and you move perpendicular to your view either
on the right or the left.  This is very popular in first person shooters where you want to be
aiming at something and then be able to dodge left or right from others shooting back at you.
This also makes moving in a 3D scene very fluid and allows for easy views of things as you
navigate around objects in the scene.

*How to code strafing*
How strafing works from a high level is you have a view vector and an up vector for a camera,
and you want to find the vector that is perpendicular (90 degrees) to the right or left of
the camera.  You then want to move the camera along that vector, depending on the strafing
direction that is desired.  There are a couple ways to find that vector, one is if you have
the view and up vector, you can take the cross product (linear algebra) between those two
vectors and it will return the vector that is perpendicular to those 2 vectors.

rightVector = cross(viewVector, upVector);

In our case, we have a rotation matrix and can easily derive vectors from taking the inverse
of that matrix and multiplying it by a default right vector of (1, 0, 0), we use vec4 since
the rotation matrix is a 4x4:

vec4 rightVector = inverse(GetRotationMatrix()) * vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);

This essentially allows us to apply rotations to a default right vector and it tell us what
it has been rotated to.  The theory might be a little bit more deep that than, but that is
the best way I can describe it.

So now that we have the right vector, then what do we do with it?  Similar to what we did
in our MoveCamera() function, we just add that vector to our camera's Position, with a
desired speed applied.

vec3 rightVector = GetRight();
Position.x += rightVector.x * speed;
Position.z += rightVector.z * speed;

That's pretty simple, but adds a great deal of fluidity to your camera.  We added back our
A/D and LEFT/RIGHT key checks in KeyPressed, and then similarly with our MoveCamera()
functionality, we pass in the speed applied to a time slice into Camera->Strafe().  Try
and see if you can add a Jump() function to your camera.
