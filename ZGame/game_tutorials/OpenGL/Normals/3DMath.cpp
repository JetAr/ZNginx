// *FINDING THE NORMAL OF A POLYGON*

// In order to find the normal of a polygon, we need to take the cross product of 2
// vectors from that polygon.  What that means, is that we need to get the directions
// of 2 of the sides of our triangle.  After all, that is all a vector is, just a direction
// and a length.  The length of our vectors in this case isn't really important.  We are
// just going to use the direction.  Then, with those 2 vectors we can find a vector coming
// straight out of the polygon, perpendicular (90 degrees) to the polygon.  To give you some
// examples of a cross product of 2 vectors, let's assume that we have a piece of paper
// lying flat on a table.  Where would the cross product of that paper be pointing?
// Straight up!  But, the paper isn't a polygon really?  Well, all you are really getting
// is the normal to a plane.  A plane is infinite, it goes on forever.  If you drew a triangle
// in the middle of the piece of paper, the normal of that triangle would be the same as the paper,
// so it doesn't matter does it?  That's why you are really getting a normal to the polygon's plane.
// If you stuck the piece of paper straight up vertically, where would the normal be?  It would
// follow the paper perfectly as a 90 degree angle, so it would now we perfectly horizontal.  Now,
// depending on the order of your vertices, it could either being pointing out on one side of the paper,
// or on the other side.  You just have to decide which order you want to use, then ALWAYS stick
// with that.  Usually, you want to do something called back face culling which doesn't
// draw the back of a polygon.  That way you aren't drawing twice as much as you could be.
// Think about it, it you have a huge 3D model, do you really need to draw the inside of
// the model?  Of course not, that would be wasteful.  You always want to have your objects
// enclosed so they don't show back of polygons.  Like in a 3D maze, you would just have
// polygon thin walls, you would have thick walls which comprised of a cube like shape.
// That way, when you get into BSP trees, you can do something called Solid Node BSP tree's.

CVector3 Cross(CVector3 vVector1, CVector3 vVector2)
{
    CVector3 vNormal;									// The vector to hold the cross product

    // Once again, if we are given 2 vectors (directions of 2 sides of a polygon)
    // then we have a plane define.  The cross product finds a vector that is perpendicular
    // to that plane, which means it's point straight out of the plane at a 90 degree angle.
    // The equation for the cross product is simple, but difficult at first to memorize:

    // The X value for the vector is:  (V1.y * V2.z) - (V1.z * V2.y)													// Get the X value
    vNormal.x = ((vVector1.y * vVector2.z) - (vVector1.z * vVector2.y));

    // The Y value for the vector is:  (V1.z * V2.x) - (V1.x * V2.z)
    vNormal.y = ((vVector1.z * vVector2.x) - (vVector1.x * vVector2.z));

    // The Z value for the vector is:  (V1.x * V2.y) - (V1.y * V2.x)
    vNormal.z = ((vVector1.x * vVector2.y) - (vVector1.y * vVector2.x));

    // *IMPORTANT* This is not communitive. You can not change the order or this or
    // else it won't work correctly.  It has to be exactly like that.  Just remember,
    // If you are trying to find the X, you don't use the X value of the 2 vectors, and
    // it's the same for the Y and Z.  You notice you use the other 2, but never that axis.
    // If you look at the camera rotation tutorial, you will notice it's the same for rotations.

    // Now we have a vector pointing straight out of the plane of the polygon.  This is the
    // direction the polygon is facing.  You use this information for numerous things like
    // lighting, camera viewing, back face culling, collision and tons of other stuff.

    // the above line.  Then you can see how long the normal is before we normalize it.
    // I strongly recommend this.  And remember, it doesn't matter how long the normal is,
    // (of course besides (0, 0, 0)), if we normalize it, it will always be of length 1 afterwards.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// That how you find the normal to a polygon.  Pretty complicated huh? :)
// well, the good thing about this is that once you code, you never have to do it
// again.  There is no need, once you already have the functions.  Eventually you
// will build up a big library of math.  As we start getting into collision you will
// see what I mean.  That is why we separated the math into a separate file, because
// you will use the same code over and over in your applications.  I know I do.
// I feel naked with out my gamemath.cpp :)
//
// Basically, let me explain the steps again to finding the normal of a polygon.
//
// 1)  First, if you have 3 points of a polygon, you can find a normal to that plane.
//     The first step you need to do is get 2 vectors from that polygon.  That means
//     that you need to pick to sides of the triangle (order is important) and subtract
//     the points from each other to get the vector of that side.  When it comes to triangles,
//     I usually get the first vector from Point3 - Point1. (V1 = P3 - P1)
//     Next, I choose Vector 2 from Point2 and Point1 (V2 = P2 - P1).
//
// 2)  Now that we have 2 vectors:  V1 and V2, we can take the cross product of those
//     2 vectors, with vector1 cross vector2.  Remember, the order is important.
//     I always go counter-clockwise.  Pick and stick!  This is important because it decides the
//     direction of the normal.  It doesn't matter which direction, as long as you do the same
//     thing for all the rest of your polygons.  You don't want mixed up normal directions.
//
// 3)  Now we should have the normal (Or direction) from the cross product of our polygon.
//     This normal has a strange length, so let's make the length (or distance from the origin) 1.
//     To do this, we take the magnitude (Deals with the length of the vector) of the normal.
//     With the magnitude, we divide the normal BY that magnitude.  That means the X, Y and Z values
//     get divided by the magnitude scalar.  A scalar is a single number like 1, 1.232, etc...
//
// That's it!  Three basic steps to finding the normal.  It is nice not to have to worry about
// all that once you have a function that does it all for you.  We call ours "Normal()".  It
// won't matter it we have a polygon of 20 vertices, all we need is just 3 points (the first 3)
// from that polygon.  That is enough to define a plane.  Then we find the normal to that plane.
//
//
// I hope this help!  Let us know at www.GameTutorials.com if this helped you at all.
//
// Good luck, and get ready for the collision tutorial next!
