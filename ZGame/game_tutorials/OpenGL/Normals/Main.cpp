// This part below is important.  We create an array of 3 CVector3's.
// We could have called it CPoint3 or CVertex3, but let's call it it CVector3.
// A CVector3 is a class that has 3 floats, x, y, and z.  We will need a class
// to hold 3D points from now on.  We chose to use a class instead of a structure
// because later we will add to this class and make it a robust vector class, but
// for now we just want 3 floats.  We will store our triangle points in this array below.
// We put a 'v' in front of 'Triangle' to show that it is of type CVector3.
// Notice that we initialize the triangle with the left point first, then right, then the top.
// This is important.  We need to stick to this order.  This is important.  I would recommend
// doing it this way, which is counter-clockwise (considering we are looking at (0, 0, 0) down
// the negative Z axis.  This will make sure that our normals are consistent.  When backface
// culling, the default order is counter-clockwise.  This was just picked as a standard.
// You can change this in OpenGL if you want though.  Check our glFrontFace() and glCullFace()
// in MSDN for more information on back face culling and how to use it.
// I labeled the points below with an '*' to give you more of a visual understanding of the poly.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// We didn't do much code in this file, but we added all our math code to 3DMath.cpp.
// This will come in handy because you can just add the .cpp and .h file to the rest
// of your projects.  You will use this and a lot more math almost every app you do.
// At least, any app that actually DOES something besides test OpenGL API's.  If you
// plan to do any lighting or collision you will definitely need this stuff.
//
// If you run this tutorial you can use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move around
// the top of the triangle so you can see how the normal will follow the triangle.
// If you still don't understand what a normal is used for, go to the next tutorial
// on collision, and it will make more sense.  Also, look over the lighting tutorial.
//
// Here is what is repeated in 3DMath.cpp:
//
// Basically, let me explain the steps again to finding the normal of a polygon.
//
// 1)  First, if you have 3 points of a polygon, you can find a normal to that plane.
//     The first step you need to do is get 2 vectors from that polygon.  That means
//     that you need to pick to sides of the triangle (order is important) and subtract
//     the points from each other to get the vector of that side.  When it comes to triangles,
//     I usually get the first vector from Point3 - Point1. (V1 = P3 - P1)
//     Next, I choose Vector 2 from Point2 and Point1 (V2 = P2 - P1).
//
// 2)  Now that we have 2 vectors:  V1 and V2, we can take the cross product of those
//     2 vectors, with vector1 cross vector2.  Remember, the order is important.
//     I always go counter-clockwise.  Pick and stick!  This is important because it decides the
//     direction of the normal.  It doesn't matter which direction, as long as you do the same
//     thing for all the rest of your polygons.  You don't want mixed up normal directions.
//
// 3)  Now we should have the normal (Or direction) from the cross product of our polygon.
//     This normal has a strange length, so let's make the length (or distance from the origin) 1.
//     To do this, we take the magnitude (Deals with the length of the vector) of the normal.
//     With the magnitude, we divide the normal BY that magnitude.  That means the X, Y and Z values
//     get divided by the magnitude scalar.  A scalar is a single number like 1, 1.232, etc...
//
// That's it!  Three basic steps to finding the normal.  It is nice not to have to worry about
// all that once you have a function that does it all for you.  We call ours "Normal()".  It
// won't matter it we have a polygon of 20 vertices, all we need is just 3 points (the first 3)
// from that polygon.  That is enough to define a plane.  Then we find the normal to that plane.
//
//
// I hope this help!  Let us know at www.GameTutorials.com if this helped you at all.
//
// Good luck, and get ready for the collision tutorial next!
