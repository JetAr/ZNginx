// This tutorial is and introduciton to quaternions.  This tutorial shows you how to
// implement rotations using quaternions.  Just the word itself sends your mind into visions
// of Albert Einstein spending days writing on multiple tiers of chalk boards.  Does
// quaternions deal with something like quantum physics?  Do I need a PHD in math to
// understand them?  Do I need to know them to do 3D game programming?  Did the Easter Bunny
// ever have to learn this stuff?
//
// Well, the answer to all these questions is no, except the Easter Bunny one.  Though
// quaternions are extremely useful for interpolating between 2 angles, they aren't the
// only way to do it, just one of the best.  So no, you don't HAVE to know about them, but if
// you are dealing with 3D graphics programming, it's crazy not to understand a bit about them.
//
// Around the eighteenth century, a man named W. R. Hamilton discovered quaternions and that
// they could be used as a 4D extension to complex numbers. Following this discovery, it was
// proven that quaternions could also be used for rotations and orientations in three dimensions.
// It wasn't until 1985 that quaternions were used in computer graphics.
//
// In essence, quaternions are used for rotations.  One of the most popular applications for
// quaternions is in character bone/skeletal animation.  Think of a quaternion as a 4D vector:
//
// q = (x, y, z, w)    or    q = w + xi + yj + zk  // i,j and k being imaginary numbers
//
// Another representation of a quaternion is:
//
// q = [w, v]
//
// "v" represents a vector (x, y, z), and "w" is a scalar.  Just when you think you are
// starting to understand what a quaternion is, a stumbling block is placed in front of you.
// That is, you can't think of the vector (x, y, z) as a 3 dimensional vector, but a vector
// in 4 dimensions.  You can't visualize this because we can't really comprehend a fourth
// dimension.  This is one of those things that you need to just accept, and move on (while
// playing Quake 3 and barreling your rail gun into your opponent's chest, which if it happens
// to be the Angelina Jolie version of Lara Croft, a big one at that).
//
// When talking about quaternions, I will be using the first representation.  Before I go
// on to more of the math, I will address the reasons why we use quaternions.
//
// Before quaternions, Euler Angles were primarily what was used to represent a rotation.
// Euler angles are defined as an angle for each axis like so:
//
// (x, y, z) or (yaw, pitch, roll) or (heading, pitch, roll)
//
// These are the same, just different representations.  "Heading" is sometimes preferred
// to "yaw" because of the Y abbreviation which confuses yaw with the y-axis.  Each angle
// has it's own rotational matrix.  That means, if each axis rotation is written with matrices
// B, C, and D, then the general matrix A can be defined as:
//
// A = BCD
//
// with B C D described as:
//
// B = [  1       0           0 ]	 C = [ cos(p)  0     sin(p) ]  D = [  cos(roll) sin(roll) 0 ]
//	   [  0  cos(yaw) -sin(yaw) ]	     [ 0       1          0 ]      [ -sin(roll) cos(roll) 0 ]
//	   [  0  sin(yaw)  cos(yaw) ]	     [[-sin(p) 0     cos(p) ]      [  0         0         1 ]
//
// Keep in mind that the order that the matrices are multiplied together is important.
//
// The famous problem with euler angles is the potential for gimbal lock.  This happens
// when a rotation "overrides" another rotation, which limits your degrees of freedom.
// Quaternions solve this problem, as well as allow a smooth rotation when interpolating
// between 2 rotations.  Though axis angle rotation may not suffer from gimbal lock, when
// interpolated, they can cause unnatural abrupt movements between the rotations.  One of the
// simplest form of quaternion interpolation is called:
//
// SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation - Strange acronym isn't it?)
//
// When would we need to interpolate between rotations?  Like I mentioned above, the perfect
// example is when doing bone animation.  Each key frame is usually stored with a rotation
// matrix, which can be converted to a quaternion.  If you have the current frame and the
// next frame's rotation stored in a quaternion, the interpolation can easily be performed,
// which will result in a new interpolated quaternion, depending on time t of course.  Check
// out the MD3 Animation tutorial on our site to see an example of SLERP in action.
//
// There are many aspects that deal with quaternions, but we will only focus on
// converting an angle axis rotation to a quaternion, then converting a quaternion to
// a rotational matrix to be applied to the current model view matrix.
//
// * PERSONAL NOTE *
// My intentions for this tutorial is not to write a sweet robust quaternion class, but
// to SLOWLY ease you into an introduction to quaternions.  For most of us on the planet
// earth, you can't learn quaternions in one sitting.  It's something that needs spoon
// feeding.  The reason for this is because not many people can understand quaternions.
// The math behind them is very complex, that it's not something that an average programmer
// can wrap their head around, unless they are fairly educated or excellent at math.  I would
// be lying if I said I fully understood them, but I do understand what they are used for and
// what they can do.  For those of you who use cosine and sine functions often, you are
// fairly comfortable with what they do, and when to use them, but if you were asked to sit
// down and write those function, many probably couldn't, at least with out a lot of research.
// The same thing applies to quaternions, you don't need to understand all the math to understand
// when to use them.  Don't get me wrong, I encourage anyone who wants to delve further and
// learn the identities and formulas that simplify to what we use here.  It can only help you,
// not hinder you.  I'll post some of my favorite links at the bottom of this tutorial for
// those who want to dive deeper into quaternions.  I want to stress this for those of you who
// want to jump out a window because they think they will never be able to be a game programmer
// without understanding them. Also I want to stress, that if you are one of those newbies that
// like to jump ahead in programming just to perform milestones for your own ego, without
// learning all the programming basics in the middle, stop reading now because your kind is
// destroying the game industry :)

// This tutorial shows a line being rotated along the y-axis using quaternions.  There is also
// a sphere being rotated around the tip of that line.
//
// The controls are:
//
// LEFT ARROW - Moves the sphere left along the line segment
// RIGHT ARROW - Moves the sphere right along the line segment
// UP ARROW - Increases the radius that the sphere rotates around the line
// DOWN ARROW - Decreases the radius that the sphere rotates around the line
// ESC - Quits the program
//
// It is assumed that by reading this tutorial you already understand what a matrix is.
// This tutorial was taken from the base of the quadric tutorial.  Though it's not necessary
// to understand this tutorial, it would be beneficial if quadrics were understood.  Note,
// when we mention quaternions, it should also be assumed that we mean unit quaternions.
// If the quaternion is not a normalized quaternion, that opens up Pandora's box of math :)

    // The equations for axis angle to quaternions are such:

    // w = cos( theta / 2 )
    // x = X * sin( theta / 2 )
    // y = Y * sin( theta / 2 )
    // z = Z * sin( theta / 2 )

    // We pass in a 4x4 matrix, which is a 1D array of 16 floats.  This is how OpenGL

// that should be confusing is where the equations come from?  What I suggest is
// getting a decent math book and working through it if you so desire.  I listed
// a bunch of links at the bottom of this page for extra reference.  This is just the
// first quaternions tutorial of the series, but in the mean time, while we add more,
// take a look around the internet.
//
// This tutorial was the simplest way to introduce quaternions that I could think of.
// When I started learning about them, I just wanted to know how to rotate something
// using quaternions.  The next step, is how to figure out how to convert a quaternion
// to a matrix, then use Spherical Linear Interpolation (or SLERP).
//
// Every decent 3D library should have a decent quaternions class, so don't sell them
// short.  Though they are not absolutely necessary, they are what the industry is turning
// to because of their smooth functionality.
//
// If you want to see the use of quaternions in character animation, check out our MD3
// animation tutorial.

// The links below are the ones I found to be most useful when learning quaternions:
//
// This is an excellent article from gamedev that describes quaternions pretty well
// http://gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1095.asp
//
// Here is a gamasutra article about quaternions and their usage in the game industry
// http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19980703/quaternions_01.htm
//
// The best matrix and quaternion FAQ around, plus a bunch of source code
// http://gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1691.asp
//
// This site is a great page for the math behind quaternions.  There is even a proof
// on how the rotation of a quaternion works.
