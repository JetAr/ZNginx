// This tutorial was sort of built from the first collision tutorial of a line and plane.
// Functions were take out that had to deal with collision because they were not used
// in this tutorial.  We added 2 more important math functions to our math library:
//
// // This returns the distance from 2 3D points
// float Distance(CVector3 vPoint1, CVector3 vPoint2);
//
// // This returns the point on a line segment that is closest to a given 3D point
// CVector3 ClosetPointOnLine(CVector3 vA, CVector3 vB, CVector3 vPoint)
//
// These functions allow us to find the closest point on a line segment from a given point.
// This is used in collision detection and a few other cases.

CVector3 ClosestPointOnLine(CVector3 vA, CVector3 vB, CVector3 vPoint)
{
    // This function takes a line segment, vA to vB, then a point, vPoint.
    // We want to find the closet point on the line segment to our vPoint
    // out in space.  Either it is going to be one of the end points of the line,
    // or it is going to be somewhere between vA and vB.  This is a important
    // function when dealing with collision detection.

    // Here is how it works, it's a bit confusing at first, so you will need
    // to contemplate it a bit.  First, we want to grab a vector from "vA" to the point.
    // Then we want to get a normalized vector from "vA" to "vB".  We don't need the
    // full length of the line segment vector, we just want a direction.  That is why
    // we normalize it.  Remember, this is important because we are going to be using
    // the dot product coming up next.  So, now we have 2 vectors that form a pseudo corner
    // of a triangle on the plane of the line segment and the point.
    //
    // Next, we want to find the distance or "magnitude" of the line segment.  This is
    // done with a simple distance formula.  Then we use the dot "vVector2" with "vVector1".
    // By using the dot product, we can essentially project vVector1 onto the
    // line segments normalized vector, "vVector2".  If the result of the dot product is
    // 0, that means the vectors were perpendicular and had a 90 degree angle between them.
    // The 0 part is the distance the new projected vector is from the starting of vVector2.
    // If the result is a negative number, that means the angle between the 2 vectors
    // is greater than 90 degrees, which means that the closest point must be "vA" because
    // it's projected vector is on the outside of the line.  So, if the result is a positive
    // number, the projected vector is on the right side of "vA", but could be past the right
    // side of vB.  To test this, we make sure that the result of the dot product is NOT
    // greater than the distance "d".  If it is, then the closest point on the plane is
    // obviously vB.
    //
    // So, we can find the closest point easily if it's one of the end points of the line
    // segment, but how do we find the point between the 2 end points?  This is simple.
    // Since we have the distance "t" from point "vA" (given to us from the dot product
    // of the 2 vectors), we just use our vector that is going the direction of the
    // line segment, "vVector2", and multiply it by the distance scalar "t".  This will
    // create a vector going in the direction of the line segment, with a distance
    // (or magnitude) of the projected vector, "vVector1", is from from "vA".  We then add
    // this vector to "vA", which gives us the point on the line that is closest to our
    // point out in space, vPoint!
    //
    // This is probably pretty hard to visualize with just comments, unless you have a good
    // grasp of linear algebra.

    // Create the vector from end point vA to our point vPoint.
    CVector3 vVector1 = vPoint - vA;

    // Create a normalized direction vector from end point vA to end point vB
    CVector3 vVector2 = Normalize(vB - vA);

    // Use the distance formula to find the distance of the line segment (or magnitude)
    float d = Distance(vA, vB);

    // Using the dot product, we project the vVector1 onto the vector vVector2.
    // This essentially gives us the distance from our projected vector from vA.
    float t = Dot(vVector2, vVector1);

    // If our projected distance from vA, "t", is less than or equal to 0, it must
    // be closest to the end point vA.  We want to return this end point.
    if (t <= 0)
        return vA;

    // If our projected distance from vA, "t", is greater than or equal to the magnitude
    // or distance of the line segment, it must be closest to the end point vB.  So, return vB.
    if (t >= d)
        return vB;

    // Here we create a vector that is of length t and in the direction of vVector2
    CVector3 vVector3 = vVector2 * t;

    // To find the closest point on the line segment, we just add vVector3 to the original
    // end point vA.
    CVector3 vClosestPoint = vA + vVector3;

    // Return the closest point on the line segment
    return vClosestPoint;

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This is one of the more simple math tutorials to code, but it's incredibly
// important to have when doing collision detection.  In the Sphere-Polygon collision
// tutorial, we will use this technique to determine the collision on the edges.
//
// Let me go over the basics of how we find the closest point on a line segment, to a
// given point.
//
// The dot product is the key function that makes all this magic work.  Basically,
// if we get a vector between an end point of the line segment and the point, plus
// a normalized directional vector of that end point to the other end point, we can
// use the dot product to project the first vector onto the directional vector.  This
// gives us a distance from the new project vector to the end point.  If that distance
// is 0, the 2 vectors were perpendicular and the projected vector is directory on top
// of the end point, which would make the distance 0.  If the distance is negative, the
// point is on the outside of the line segment and closest to that end point.  If the
// distance is positive; we know that the point is on the other side of the end point.
// If we find the distance of the line segment, we can then check to see if the point
// is closest to a point on the line, or it is past the other end point, which makes that
// other end point the closest point to our given point.  To check the closest point
// is inside the line and not an end point, we just make sure that the original dot product
// result is less than the distance of the line segment. This distance can be calculated
// using the normal distance formula you use in algebra.
//
// So to sum it all up... if the distance "t" is less than 0, our first end point is the
// closest point on the line, where if the distance "t" is greater than the distance of
// the line, distance "d", then it's the other end point.  If both of those fail, it must
// be on the line between the 2 end points.  To calculate where, we multiply our directional
// vector times the result of the dot product.  Then add that result to our original end point.
// That will give us the closest point on the line, between the 2 end points.
