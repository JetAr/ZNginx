// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// We have just added Bounding Box Collision and Sliding to our collision detection.
// The only thing we are missing now is jumping, gravity and being able to walk up
// stairs.
//
// This tutorial wasn't so hard, but it is important to get the basics down with our
// collision before we go onto more advanced topics.  There are many people that
// ask how to do sliding collision detection, so I figured if we made a more simpler
// tutorial people could pick out how to accomplish this effect, even if they aren't
// interested in doing BSP collision detection.
//
// In this file we added a new function TraceBox() for AABB collision detection.
// We also added in the Trace() function the ability to slide off of the walls when
// we collide.  Simple, but pretty cool huh?
//
// Good luck on your collision!
