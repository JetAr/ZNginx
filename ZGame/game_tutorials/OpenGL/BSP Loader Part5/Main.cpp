//
// This is the fifth tutorial of our Quake 3 BSP Loader series.  In this version
// we add sliding to our collision detection.  Also, instead of using sphere
// collision we use AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision.
//
// * What is Sliding? *
//
// You notice that in the last tutorial had some pretty rouch collision detection.
// When I say rough, I mean that there was virtually no response when the user ran
// into a wall.  All we did was just stop, and we couldn't move any further.  A much
// more fluid and natural way to handle the collision is to produce a sliding effect.
// That means that when the user collides with any geometry, the user will slide off
// in the direction of the view vector (or movement vector).  This way the user doesn't
// need to back up and move another direction after a collision.  This sliding effect
// is what you will see on most First-Person-Shooter games like Quake.
//
// So how does it work?  Let's go over the math for sliding:
//
// 1) TheMoveVector = TheEndPoint - TheNewPointFromCollision;
//
//    - So we grab the movement vector, but backwards.  This is because
//      we want to send a vector backwards from the end point.  Of course,
//      we don't want to send the movement vector, we want to send the
//      projected movement onto the normal of the plane back from the end point.
//      Let's do that next:
//
// 2) DistanceFromEndPointToIntersection = Dot(TheMoveVector, ThePlaneNormal);
//
//	  - Here we use the dot product between the movement vector and the normal of
//      the plane that we collided with to get the distance that we need to travel
//      backwards along the normal's vector.  So now we have a distance to scooch
//      is backwards to provide the new point we will slide to.  Let's do the last
//      step:
//
// 3) TheNewSlidingPoint = TheEndPoint - (ThePlaneNormal * DistanceFromEndPointToIntersection);
//
// That's it!  We got a new position that throws us back from the end point we tried to
// go, to the new position along the planes vector, which creates a sliding effect.  There
// is one more thing we need to do however, and that is we need to test one more collision
// detection call on the new sliding position.  This is because, if we keep sliding into
// some sort of corner, the player will slide right out of the world.  We need to verify that
// that new sliding position is not colliding through the world geometry.  You do this by just
// passing in the new sliding position and and end position into the Trace() function.
// You will see this in action in Quake3Bsp.cpp in our Trace() function.
//
// Be sure to note that this is just one way to get the sliding position.  There are tons
// of ways in math to get this new slide vector, so use what ever one you life.
//
// * What is a AABB? *
//
// AABB stands for Axis-Aligned Bounding Box.  That means that we have a box that is
// aligned with the axis at the origin (XYZ).  The box isn't tilted or rotated in any way.
// We place an AABB around our camera (or character) to test for more accurate collision
// detection in regards to dimensions.  If you have a tall character, you can't really
// represent the character accurately with a sphere, so we use a box to surround the
// character which will act as a better representation of the character's geometry.
// No matter which direction the player is facing, however, the box will never rotate,
// but will be always aligned with the XYZ axis perfectly, standing straight up.
//
// With this type of simple geometry we can perform collision detection tests quite
// fast, with not to much more overhead than a sphere test.  To calculate a AABB, you
// don't need all of the corners of the box, but just a bottom corner and a top corner
// that is on the opposite side of the bottom corner.  We call this the Min and Max's
// of the AABB.  With just these 2 points, you can see how we can tell the dimensions of
// the box without having all of the corners.
//
// Just like we did with the sphere, when checking collision we will use a an offset
// for the AABB that will determine if we collided with the brushes (world geometry).
//
// ***
//
// We added some code in Camera.cpp to our function where we check for movement.
// In the last tutorial, you'll notice that if we backed ourself into a wall, the
// view vector would eventually eclipse the camera's position and then face the
// camera backwards.  I add now a way to stop the view vector from going backwards
// behind the camera position if you back into a wall and keep moving back.  This
// will fix some strange behavior in the tutorial.
//
// There wasn't any changes in this file, but you can go over to Quake3Bsp.cpp and
// see the things we added to allow AABB collision and sliding.	In the next tutorial
// we will go over gravity, jumping and going up stairs/slopes.
//
// Enjoy!
