// This is the long-awaited tutorial on bone animation.  We will be loading
// our own .GTF format for the animation data.  This file format was exported
// from 3D Studio Max.  You can find the format for this file below.  It is
// assumed that you have gone through all of the previous tutorials in this
// loader/exporter series and understand the concepts.  Below we explain
// again what bone animation is and the difference with weighted animation.
//
// * What is bone animation? *
//
// If you have never worked with bone animation, let's go over the basics
// of how it works.  When creating a character, artists will usually make
// a character with their arms pointing outward.  This is because it's
// easier to apply bones to the character that way.  Usually the character
// is one or so objects, so in order to animate the object(s) you need bones
// that are attached to the model to influence the mesh.  Once you attach
// the bones like a skeleton you can move the bones and they will move the
// vertices that are closest to the bone.  It's like a puppet.
//
// When exporting the bone animation data, you export a matrix for every
// bone and for every frame of the animation.  We want to use quaternions
// so we export a separate translation position and the quaternion rotation.
//
// * What is weighted bone animation? *
//
// Weighted bone animation means that if you have a huge fat character that
// you want his chubby stomach to bounce around to simulate realism, Max
// allows us to apply special weighting to different parts of the body.
// For every vertice there is a weight attached that influences it.  If
// there are many different weights applied to the model then all those
// weights are factored in as well.
//
// * How does weighted bone animation work? *
//
// Let's go through briefly the process of how weighted bone animation works.
// First, we need have a current frame and the next frame of animation.  We
// use those numbers to index into our bone animation lists.  We basically
// take the current frame and the next frame's rotation and do spherical
// linear interpolation (SLERP) between the two.  Then we multiply that
// by the current vertex position.  The next thing is to add the translation
// value to the rotated position, but we don't just add the translation,
// we do linear interpolation between the current translation and the next
// frame of animation's translation.  That result is then added to our
// rotated position.  We have a running "t" for the time in the interpolation
// that is calculated every frame, depending on the frame rate of the animation.
//
// Finally, we need to add the weights to our final vertex.  This whole process
// is done as many times as there is weights for the model (numBlendLinks).  If
// there is weighted animation then the numBlendLinks is usually the amount of
// bones in the model.  For every bone's weight we apply it to the new position
// and keep adding up the result for every weight.  If there is no weighted
// animation then there is only one weight link and it has a weight value of 1.0,
// which means you apply the new position by 100%.
//
// This process will be explained in detail in the function RenderModel(),
// located in GTF.cpp.
//
// * Additions *
//
// We added a great deal of math to our project in order to make the animation
// work.  This means there is a bit of matrix, quaternion and linear algebra
// functions added.  You will notice that we grew our CVector3 class to have
// some basic functionality with operator overloading.  Most of the math code
// is taken from the MD3 animation tutorial, especially the quaternions code.
// I will leave a lot of the comments that describe much of the functions in
// case you haven't viewed the MD3 tutorial and/or you don't understand the
// concepts.
//
// Among other things, we added the code to load the animation data from our
// .GTF file.  Since animation is dependant on timing, we also added a couple
// functions to update the timing for the desired frame rate of the animation.
// Lists and other variables were added to some of our model structures to
// handle the bone animation data.  Finally, we added the code to actually
// perform the bone animation in RenderModel().
//
// * We won't handle separate animations *
//
// In this tutorial we won't be handling animations like in our previous
// animation tutorials.  We will just loop through a walk cycle animation
// and not select specific animations.  I figure that you can do that yourself
// and have your own desired format for controlling which animations are playing,
// also it would just bloat our code and make it more confusing.  Check out the
// MD2 and MD3 animation tutorials for examples.
//
// Also, in the original Vick.max file we have all the animations for an MD3 model.
// We just exported the Vick_Walk.max file to show a single animation looping over
// again.  If you export the Vick.max file and watch the animations being played you
// might see some stretching between some of the transitions to different animations.
// This is because you will not want to try and interpolate the last frame of an
// animation cycle with the first frame of another animation cycle.  Depending on the
// positions of the 2 frames it will sometimes create a funny stretching effect.  To
// get around this you can do 2 things:
//
// 1) When the last frame is played of an animation cycle just set the vertices to
//    the first frame of the next animation cycle.  This is of course a quick jump
//    that isn't the best option, but get's rid of ugly stretching that appears
//    sometimes.  Most older games use this method because it's the easiest.
//
// 2) The best way to switch between animations is to use a method of called
//    "animation blending".  This doesn't instantly switch animations in a frame, but
//    takes a couple to a bunch of frames (however fast you need to transition) and
//    blends the bone animation through interpolation.  Imagine a character walking
//    and then slowly the animation turns into a run.  That is the effect that you
//    want.
//
//
// * GTF file format *
//
// Below is the new format with the added material data:
//
// * "GT3D" (4 characters)
// * Exporter Version (1 float)
// * Number of Objects/Meshes (1 int)
// *	Number of Materials (1 int)
// *	Material Name ( Number of Materials * char[MAX_FILE_NAME])
// *	Number of Vertices (1 int)
// *	Vertices ( Number of Vertices * CVector3)
// *	Number of Indices (1 int)
// *	Indices ( Number of Indices * int)
// *	Number of UV Coordinates (1 int)
// *	UV Coords ( Number of UV Coords * CVector3)
// *	Number of Texture Indices (1 int)
// *	Texture Indices ( Number of Texture Indices * int)
//
// *	Has Skeletal Anim Bool ( 1 bool )
// *	Number of Weights ( 1 int )
// *	Weight Info ( Number of Weights * CVector2)
// *	Frame Rate ( 1 int )
// *	Number of Frames ( 1 int )
// *		Translation (1 CVector3 )
// *		Quaternion ( 1 CVector4 )
//
//
//
//
// * Application Controls *
//
// ESC   - Quits the program
// W     - Turns wireframe on and off
// LEFT  - Rotates the model left
// RIGHT - Rotates the model right
//
// Now let's get on with the tutorial and go view the code.  There isn't
// anything in this file that has changed, so you can just right into
// GTF.cpp.  Be sure to also check out the header files, as they have
// changed a bit too.
