This is the next tutorial in the modern OpenGL series which builds upon the previous tutorial
where we displayed a white triangle on the screen with OpenGL 4.  In this tutorial we will be
passing in colors to the GPU in order to color the triangle.  Now that we have a great base
for our modern OpenGL application, adding colors is relatively simple.

1) First we add a rgba property to our Vertex3 class, so that we can pass in a Red, Green,
   Blue and Alpha value along with each vertex of our triangle.

2) We then need to add the color attributes to our Vertex Array Object and Vertex Buffer Object.
   We do this by adding the size and location of the rgba property via glVertexAttribPointer():

   glVertexAttribPointer(kColorIndex, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertices[0]), (GLvoid*)sizeof(Vertices[0].xyz));

   This takes an index to be referenced in the vertex shader (kColorIndex = 1), the number of
   floats (4 for r,g,b,a), the type which is a GL_FLOAT, we don't want it normalized so GL_FALSE,
   the size of a single Vertex3 object, and then a void pointer to the start of the location
   within the Vertex3 class to the rgba property, which is right after the xyz variable.  By
   giving a pointer to the size of the xyz variable, we give the offset in bytes into the class.

3) Now that we have a new index attribute for color, we need to enable it with the kVertexIndex
   by calling glEnableVertexAttribArray(kColorIndex), and then disabling it with a call to
   glDisableVertexAttribArray(kColorIndex).

4) Finally, now that we are passing in colors to the shaders, we need to create a new in_Color
   property that will then be passed over to the fragment shader for that vertex:

   layout(location=1) in vec4 in_Color;

   The location=1 maps to the same location index that we used to pass in the color attributes
   with kColorIndex.  We then create and set an out variable within the vertex shader to pass
   the fragment shader, since we have to pass any variables through the vertex shader and can't
   pass them directly to a fragment shader.

   out vec4 frag_Color;

   void main(void)
   {
	   ...
	   frag_Color = in_Color;
   }

5) Finally, we need take the frag_Color that was sent over to the fragment shader and instead
   of hard coding our color like last time, we set the out_Color to our frag_Color.

   in vec4 frag_Color;
   layout(location=0) out vec4 out_Color;

   void main(void)
   {
	   out_Color = frag_Color;
   }

These are the only changes (other than a window title) that have changed since the later
tutorial, which can be found with NEW blocks in Main.cpp, Model.cpp, Model.h and the shaders.
