//
// Welcome to one of the most awaited series of tutorials from GameTutorials.
// In this tutorial we will go over how to setup and create a basic exporter
// for Autodesk's® 3D Studio Max®.  Eventually, the three-part tutorial
// series will export a bone-animated model to our own special format.  The
// exporter can also be used to export not just character models but fully-
// textured worlds.
//
// * What is 3D Studio Max®? *
//
// Among other things, 3D Studio Max® is 3D editor that can create amazing 3D
// worlds and animation.  This program is used by many game developers, as well
// as many of the animation we see in movies.  Another popular 3D editor is Maya®.
//
// * What is an exporter? *
//
// When we create our cool models and worlds in a 3D editor, we need to "export"
// that model data (vertices, texture coordinates, etc.) to a file that can be
// read into our own program.  Since most file formats don't support bone
// animation, we need to create our own file format that stores that information.
// We do this by creating our own "exporter" that will spit out all the needed
// information into a file.  We create a .GTF file format.  The exporter is
// actually a DLL that is changed to a .DLE file and stored in the Plugins\
// folder located in your 3D Studio Max® directory.  When 3DS Max® loads it will
// check the plugins folder and load all the plugins.  You can then choose the
// "File->Export" option, which will bring up file formats that you can export
// your data to.  If your exporter is loaded its file format will be an option.
//
// * The exporter is a DLL? *
//
// Correct!  We need to create a DLL project, not a console or Win32 application.
// If you are unsure how to create a DLL, please refer back to our DLL tutorial.
// Make sure you create the DLL with no added files to it, otherwise Visual
// Studio will add unneeded files and settings.
//
// * Video tutorials included *
//
// Be sure to view our video tutorials that are included with this tutorial that
// show you how to setup your project settings correctly, as well as using the
// plugin in 3DS Max.  You can access these tutorials by clicking on the
// "GTExporter.htm" file.  Make sure you have the correct codec installed.  You
// can find a link for the TechSmith codec at the bottom of the html page.
//
// * MAX SDK is needed to compile *
//
// In order to compile a Max exporter you need to have the SDK for the current
// version of Max that you are running.  You can download version 5.0 of the SDK
// online from Discreet's website.  If you are running version 6.0 and up the
// exporters should work for 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0.  I am running version 7.0 for
// this tutorial.
//
// * DEF file needed *
//
// You will notice in the current project's folder there is a file called
// GTExporter.def.  This file is needed for Max to load our exporter.  The
// file consists of the following:
//
// LIBRARY GTExporter
// EXPORTS
// 	 LibDescription			@1
// 	 LibNumberClasses		@2
// 	 LibClassDesc			@3
//	 LibVersion				@4
// SECTIONS
//	 .data READ WRITE
//
// This just tells Max what we called our main class and the rest is just
// standard data that you won't need to change.
//
// * Exporter class explanations *
//
// There are 2 classes that we create in order to have an exporter.  We first
// create a class inherited of type:  ClassDesc2.  You can call the class
// whatever you want, but in this tutorial we use the name: GTExporterClassDesc.
// This class contains basic data access functions for getting things like our
// library description, ID and hInstance.
//
// The last class we create is inherited from this Max class: SceneExport.
// We call the class "GTExporter".  This class is what we will be
// primarily working with.  This handles all of our exporter functionality.
//
// Really, the main functions that you will want to focus on is these:
// ExportGeometry() and ExtractFaceData().  The rest will just be mostly setup
// and stuff that you probably won't ever change.  Of course, the functions
// below those will most likely be changed to fit your own file format.
//
// * GTF file format *
//
// We created a basic file format to save our 3D data to (.GTF).
// Below is the format:
//
// * "GT3D" (4 characters)
// * Exporter Version (1 float)
// * Number of Objects/Meshes (1 int)
// *	Number of Vertices (1 int)
// *	Vertices ( Number of Vertices * CVector3)
// *	Number of Indices (1 int)
// *	Indices ( Number of Indices * int)
//
//
// That's it!  Since we want to be able to load many objects we first need
// to figure out how many objects there are.  We count the meshes in the
// world, write that to our file header, then we export each object's data.
// Notice that we write a "Key" and a version to our .gtf file.  This is to
// make sure that what we are loading is a true .gtf file.
//
// It is assumed that by reading this tutorial you understand the basics of
// file loading and character animation.  The next tutorials will show how
// to export texture and animation/bone data.
//
// * SDK knowledgebase online *
//
// The SDK knowledgebase has a lot of information (sometimes hard to find)
// about the API used to export/import data from Max.  You can access the
// knowledgebase for the Max SDK online at:
//
// http://sparks.discreet.com/search/
//
//
// In conjunction with this tutorial series, we also created a GTLoader
// tutorial series that shows how to load and animate the characters we
// export from Max.  Be sure to use GTLoader Part1 for this version of
// the exporter.
//
// Let's get into the code and explain how it works.

    // don't have a huge messy function, we will break up the exporting processes

    // exported we created STL vectors for the vertices and the indices.  If
    // you are unfamiliar with how file loading and exporting works, let me give
    // a quick explanation on what we store for vertices and indices.
    //
    // Take a cube for instance.  How many unique vertices are there in a cube?
    // 8 right?  4 on top and 4 on bottom right?  Well, when we extract the vertices
    // from Max's face data, it comes to around 24 vertices; however, only 8 of them
    // are unique.  We only want to save unique vertices because it takes less space
    // in our files, as well as being nice to setup for vertex buffers and such.
    // Instead of saving all the 24 vertex data of the cube, we just save the unique
    // vertices, then create an array of integers called "indices".  This array stores
    // in order the correct index into our vertex array that needs to be draw next.
    // Thus, we have a list for unique vertices and our indices.
    //
    // Also, one thing that needs to be understood is the whole "Tri Object" thing.
    // There are many different way to create 3D models in 3DS Max, like NURBS and
    // such that aren't stored in triangle formats.  We want our data stored in
    // triangles so we need to convert the data to a "Tri Object", which is an
    // object that is comprised of triangles.  We then have to remember to free it.

    // Like in the previous functions, we want to get the pointer to the current
    // object.  Some meshes have animation, so to show you how to just get the data

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Not sure bad is it?  The hard part is just knowing how to traverse the nodes
// and which Max functions do what.  This portion of the tutorial series will just
// export basic face information with vertices.  The next tutorial will delve into
// extracting texture coordinates and materials.
//
// You can test this exporter by using the Loader Part1 tutorial.  Be sure to
// check out DLLEntry.cpp and Exporter.h to see the basic classes needed to have
// an exporter.
