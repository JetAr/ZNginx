// In this version of our tutorial we added the ability to only draw what's in the
// camera's frustum.  This is done by PVSs (Potential Visibility Sets) and frustum
// culling.  We needed to read in the BSP tree data from the file to help us out
// with this.  The rendering loop now goes through every leaf, checks if it's
// visible from the current cluster, then checks if it's inside of the frustum.
// Both of these checks need to happen, not just the frustum culling, or else
// face data behind walls will get drawn when it isn't needed.  It's better to
// make the extra checks that it is to draw more polygons, from a high level that
// is...
//
//
// Be sure to look at the HTML file format that was included with this tutorial.
// It has the whole file format and added information not discussed in this tutorial.
