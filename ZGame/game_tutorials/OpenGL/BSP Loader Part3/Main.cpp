/////// * /////////// * /////////// * NEW * /////// * /////////// * /////////// *
//
// This is the third tutorial of our Quake 3 BSP Loader series.  In this version
// we implement the PVS (Potential Visibility Set) and frustum culling.  That means
// that we won't need to draw the whole world every frame, but only the world that
// is in our frustum.  To "cull" (not draw) sections of the world, it will take 2
// parts.  The first part will be checking the PVS sections against the current one
// we are in, then once a visible section is found from our section, we check the
// BSP leaf's bounding box inside of that cluster against the frustum.  If
// it's inside the frustum, then we draw all of those faces assigned to that leaf.
// Be sure to check the HTML Quake 3 Format document that came with this tutorial
// to get more information about how the PVS data is read and works.  This is
// probably the hardest part about the Quake 3 format to wrap your head around.
// I will try and make it as easy to grasp as possible.
//
// Basically, when the level is compiled into a .bsp file, the PVS data is
// precalculated and saved into a large bitset for each cluster.
//
// * What's A Cluster? *
//
// A cluster is essentially a section in the world that contains a bunch of BSP leaf
// nodes.  There are probably a few names for this, but we will call it a cluster.
// By having clusters that define certain parts of the world, it allows us to cull
// huge parts of the level.  Each cluster has a list of all the rest of the clusters,
// and if each one can or can't be seen from itself.  For instance, imagine that
// you are in an enclosed room with an open door, and the room constitutes 1 cluster.
// You only need to draw the data in that room, along with the data of the cluster that is
// right outside of door, say in a hallway.  The rest of the world is totally ignored.
// For indoor levels this is incredibly fast.  It allows you to not draw anything
// behind walls and doors and such.  With an octree, you would still be drawing
// data that was behind walls because the nodes bounding boxes would still be in your
// frustum.  You have no way to tell if it can't be seen or not, at least efficiently.
// That is why if you have an outdoor and indoor scene, it's best to try and mix both
// techniques.
//
// Instead of drawing the level by going through all of the faces, we change the rendering
// loop to going through each end leaf in the BSP tree.  We first find the leaf that the
// camera is in by testing the camera position against all of the BSP splitter planes.
// These are all given to us in the .BSP file.  Each leaf has a cluster index given
// to it, so we know which leaf belongs to which cluster.  Once we find the leaf we are in,
// we then test all the rest of the leaf's clusters against our leaf's cluster to see if
// we even need to consider drawing that leaf and it's faces.  This will make more sense
// once you check out the new code in RenderLevel().
//
// * What's All This BSP Garbage You Keep Mentioning? *
//
// If you don't know what a BSP tree is, I suggest looking on the internet for the
// BSP FAQ done by SGI.  It explains every question you might have.  Basically, a
// BSP tree is a Binary Space Partitioning Tree.  The word "binary" denotes that the
// tree only has at most 2 child nodes for ever parent node.  The end nodes, or
// "leaf nodes" hold the face data, similar to how the octree's end nodes work.  The
// 2 child nodes hold the "front" and "back" nodes.  The BSP also has splitter planes
// associated with each node that were used to determine that nodes front and back nodes.
// The Quake 3 tools create the BSP tree for us, we just need to read in the data.
// Instead of storing pointers to the front back nodes to create a linked list, Quake 3
// stores indices into the node array.  If the index is a negative number, we can then
// convert that index into a leaf index by using the ~ binary operator, or -(i + 1),
// since the first index starts at 0 in the leaf array.
//
// The BSP tree data isn't used so much for rendering as it was in the old Doom I & II
// games, but is used for collision detection.  This will explained later in a future
// tutorial.
//
// There isn't that much new code added to this tutorial (assuming you have already
// seen the frustum culling code before in previous tutorials), so you shouldn't need
// to worry about having a ton of PVS and BSP code being shoved down your throat.
// The Quake 3 tools do most of the work for us, we just need to read in the results.
//
// If you haven't done any frustum culling before in OpenGL, check out our tutorial
// on the topic at www.GameTutorials.com.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Not much was added to this file for this tutorial version.  We did need to
// calculate the frustum each frame, and we also added the visible faces to our
// window's title bar. That way as you move throughout the world you can see how
// much culling is being performed.
//
// The controls for this tutorial are:
//
// w, s, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW - Move the camera forward and backward
// a, d, RIGHT_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW - Strafe the camera left and right
// Mouse movement - Moves the view for first person mode
// Left  Mouse Button - Turns lightmaps on and off
// Right Mouse Button - Turns textures on and off
// Space Bar - Turns wireframe on and off
// ESCAPE - Quits the program
//
// Remember to refer back to the HTML file that comes with this tutorial to
// learn more about the file format.  I skipped a bunch of information because
// it's already in that file.
//
// Be sure to include to correct libraries listed at the top and in the read me.
//
// Let me know what you think of this tutorial, I would love to hear your
// feedback and any cool projects you create with it.
