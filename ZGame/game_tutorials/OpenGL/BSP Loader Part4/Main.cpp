//
// This is the fourth tutorial of our Quake 3 BSP Loader series.  In this version
// we implement collision between the camera and the world.  Yes!  Finally!  You
// can make your game a reality, which cool collision detection.  This is probably
// one of the most difficult things to program in 3D for a game.  Sure, after our
// tutorials you will see that it's not so hard to get the camera colliding with
// the world data, but there is so many little bugs and problems with the collision
// as you create your game that it makes it a real problem for you.  You might even
// find yourself doing a little "walking through walls" in this tutorial series.
// In almost every game you can find some little glitch with the collision.  It's
// hard to track down because it's very rare that it happens.  But, we'll show you
// some general collision detection and then you can adapt it to what you want to
// do with your own project.  The collision that we will do in this first tutorial
// will be just basic running into the walls.  You won't slide off the walls like
// in 3D games, but we will cover "sliding" in the next tutorial with bounding box
// collision detection.
//
// * What's new in this tutorial? *
//
// Well, we add a couple more structures for brushes in our QuakeBSP.h file.
// This allows us to load in information about the collision boundaries for
// the world.  These boundaries (or planes) are stored in the "brushes".  We also
// use texture information to check if we are running into a wall or something that is
// transparent like a sprite or water, which we don't want to collide with of course.
// We then do some checks with a bounding sphere and the brushes for the level.
// If our sphere collides with the level data, then we stop and don't allow the user
// to go any further.
//
// * DigiBen, Give it too us simply - How does this collision work? *
//
// Well, if you're gonna be pushy, I'll just get to the juice.  We have a camera
// right?  The camera is stored with just some points/vectors.  You don't want to
// just collide against the world with your camera's position.  Since we are doing
// a third person type of view, we assume we are a character.  That means the
// dimensions of a character are much larger than a single point (unless you're a
// cheater and you create a character that is a single point so no one can shoot
// you).  Usually in games there is a bounding sphere, box or cylinder that surrounds
// the character to quickly check collision against the level and other characters.
// This gets rid of checking all the character's vertices every time.  The fastest
// collision is probably a bounding sphere because it only uses a center point and
// a radius to check against the world.  This is the test we will use in this tutorial.
// The next tutorial will use an AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box).  This is much more
// realistic for a character, since characters are usually taller than they are more
// wide.  AABB are still really fast, but require just a bit more code to make work.
//
// So, anyway... let's explain the collision.  So, we have our position and a radius.
// We are checking the characters sphere against a bunch of planes that are stored
// in the BSP brushes.  These brushes hold the bounding volumes for the world data.
// Well, when the player moves he/she creates a vector: The original position and
// the new position that it will try and move.  This vector can also be called a "ray".
// We just check this ray to see if it collides with any of the brushes' planes.
// If it does collide (meaning that when we pass in the ray start and end points into
// the "plane equation: Ax + By + Cz - distance = 0 : PlaneNormal.x*point.x +
// PlaneNormal.y*point.y + PlaneNormal.z*point.z - PlaneDistanceFromOrigin = 0, but
// instead of 0 it will be a positive number if the point is in front of the plane and
// a negative number if it's behind the plane - so check if the start and end point
// are oppositve signs and that's a collision), then we can only advance the camera
// enough to be against the plane, but not going through it.  Since we aren't working
// with vertice data, we need to not just check on a plane, but make sure that we are in
// fact inside the brushes' boundaries.  These brushes make up a convex volume, which
// means that there is no caps in the hull of the brush.  It is a solid object with planes
// that make up that object, like a box.  Since planes are infiniate, we could be 400
// million miles from the actual level data, but be colliding with one of it's brushes.
// To get around this, we need to make sure either the end point is behind all of the
// brushes, or the ray (movement vector) collided with a corner or some other outside
// point of the brush's boundaries.  That is what the whole tutorial is pretty much
// about, doing those calculations.  At first the calculations and tons of checks
// might get overwhelming, but it's better understand on paper if you do an example
// for yourself.
//
// Enough talking about collision, let's look at the actual code.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
//
// Nothing was really added in this file.  The camera position was changed for
// the Level.bsp file.  The biggest addition to this tutorial was series was
// of course in Quake3BSP.cpp file.  The beef of this tutorial is discussed in
// this file.
//
// * What's Next? *
//
// The next tutorial for the Quake3BSP tutorial series will focus on using
// AABB (axis aligned bounding box) to surround the player.  We will then show
// how to make the player slide along the walls.  The tutorial after that will
// show how to have gravity with jumping and walking up and down stairs/slopes.
// This is what you really want to learn right!?!?!?  I thought so :)
