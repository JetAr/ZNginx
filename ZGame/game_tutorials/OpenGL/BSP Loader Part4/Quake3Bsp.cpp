// * Knowledge Assumption *
//
// Okay, this is going to be a bit of explanation that will involve patience for
// those who are new to collision detection.  I recommend viewing our simple
// tutorials that deal with basic collision detection.  So I don't have to explain
// every little thing about collision, I will just assume that you have a basic
// knowledge of how to do basic collision detection tests like a ray and plane, etc...
//
// Okay, are you excited to actually get this collision detection under your belt?!?!
// Well, if not, I am excited enough for the both of us just teaching it :)  Here is how
// it works:
//
// 1)  We take our start and end position of the camera, which makes a ray (line or vector).
//     We then use that movement vector and test it against the brushes, which are
//     just a bunch of planes that make up a convex volume, like a box or platform.
//
// 2)  With our movement vector (startPos - endPos) we test that against all the planes
//     of a brush.  There is brushSides which store the plane information like the normal
//     and the distance the plane is from the origin.  This is necessary to have for doing
//     the plane equation (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0).  If you don't understand this, please read
//     our other tutorials on collision to get the basics of how collision works.  If you
//     don't get the plane equation, you won't get this tutorial.
//
//     * Plane Equation Quick Review *
//
//     Since I know many of you reading this will be to excited to get collision working
//     you will ignore it, so I'll tell you about the plane equation in a sentence or 2 (or 6) :)
//     The plane equation is a way to test a point against a plane to see how far the point
//     is from the plane.  If the point used to test is a point ON the plane, then the result
//     will be 0, which means that the point has no distance from the plane since it's on it.
//     What we do is not use a point on the plane, but we want to check the points of our
//     movement vector against the brush planes.  The ABC of the plane equation is the normal
//     of the plane (A = NormalX, B = NormalY, C = NormalZ).  the xyz is the point we are
//     going to test.  The D is the distance the plane is from the origin.  If the result of
//     the equation is positive, that means the point we checked against the normal of the plane
//     is in front of the plane, whereas if it's negative it will of course be behind the plane.
//     If both points of our movement vector are in front of all the planes (positive), then we
//     most likely didn't collide into the hull of the object.  This of course isn't always
//     true since we could have clipped a corner of the brush.  We do a special algorithm to
//     check this.  It's actually quite brilliant, ... too bad I didn't invent it :)
//
// 3)  If our end point isn't inside of the brush (behind all of the planes), then we don't
//     just stop there, we need to check to see if we either hit a corner of the brush or
//     our speed was so great that we happened to clear straight through the whole brush in
//     one frame.  We do this by creating a startRatio and an endRatio.  We set the startRatio
//     at -1.0 and put the endRatio at 1.0 to represent our start and end position.  We then
//     go through each of the brush sides and check find the intersection point (or distance
//     ratio) for each plane.  BUT, we only get the intersection ratio for the startRatio
//     if the startRatio (startPosition) is in front of the plane.  Otherwise we check the
//     other planes with the endRatio (endPosition).  When we get the ratio of the collision
//     point on the plane for the start and end ratio, we set the start and end ratio with
//     the new ratio (collision intersection ratio on the plane).  If the startRatio is greater
//     than the endRatio, there is no collision, otherwise we collide with the brush!
//
//     No matter how hard you explain this, it probably won't make sense unless you see a
//     picture (I'm at least a visual person).  Frank Puig Placeres ( fpuig2003@yahoo.com )
//     drew a great example of how this collision works.  Check out this picture:
//
//     BrushCollision.htm (The picture that describes how we check brush collision)
//
// 4)  If we didn't have a collision, we just return with no change, but if we did have a
//     collision, we need to move the camera (or player) collision back in front of the
//     brush planes that it collided with.  After we know there is a collision, we don't
//     need the endRatio data, but we need to store the last startRatio.  We store that in
//     a variable called the traceRatio (m_traceRatio).  You will find that when doing
//     collision and working with BSP info, the word "Trace" will be used often.  It isn't
//     intuitive to me as much as other words, but I chose to use it so that you will be
//     familiar with it when you see it everywhere else.
//
// 5)  Now that we have the last startRatio and stored it in the m_traceRatio, we can move
//     our camera (or player) to the correct position so that it isn't inside the brush.
//     we do that with this equation:
//
//	   vNewPosition = vStart + (vEnd - vStart) * m_traceRatio;
//
//     Now if you are like me and don't always undersatnd math when you first see it,
//     let me explain why this works.  The vStart is our start position of the camera
//     before we tried to move.  We want to start from our start position and add the
//     ratio that is from our start position to the collision point on the brush's plane.
//     Since the ratio isn't a vector, it's just a distance, we need to take that distance
//     and make it into a vector, which will be added to vStart (our initial position).
//     To turn the distance into a vector and give it a direction, we multiply the
//     distance from the start position to the collision point (m_traceRatio) by the
//     vector of our direction that we were headed, which equates to our end point
//     minus our initial position (vEnd - vStart).  This gives us a vector to add to
//     our initial position (vStart) that has a distance and a direction to the collision
//     point on the plane (intersection point).
//
// 6)  Finally, we set our camera position to the new position (vNewPosition) so that
//     we aren't allow to go through the walls and world data.  This is how it works!
//
// So these are the basic six steps of what we are doing in this tutorial to test collision.
// Of course, in the next tutorials we will get a bit more complicated when we deal with
// sliding, gravity and climbing stairs, but for now this is important to initially understand
// in order to progress and code the rest of the physics for your project.  We actually
// will be working with a kEpsilon value to compensate for floating point errors, which
// is 0.03125 (This is what Quake uses).  This is because 0.0 doesn't always mean a clean
// 0.0 because of floating point problems.  It could mean 0.0000001898908 and we wouldn't
// ever really know.  Unless we don't specifically set a float to 0, it's dangerous and
// uncertain to assume that it's ever really 0.
//
// Well, let's stop talking about the code and actually get to the guts of BSP Collision!
// (Be sure to check out BrushCollision.htm before looking at the code so you understand
//  what we are actually trying to do).

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// We did it!  Hopefully this wasn't too overwhelming for you.  Now that we got
// the base done, the rest of the tutorials in this series should be a piece of
// cake.  I'd even be so bold as to say carrot cake!
//
// Be sure to notice that we changed the pTextures to m_pTextures in our load
// function.  This is so we can save the texture information in our class for
// knowing what kind of a brush we are colliding with.  We also added the code
// to free that information in our DeInit() function.  You'll also notice new
// lines of code in our constructor (init function) to initialize the new variables.
//
// The hardest part about this tutorial in my mind is wrapping your head around
// the splitting part in CheckNode().  We need to split up our movement vector (ray)
// if the start and end point lie on a different side of a plane.
//
// In this tutorial all we do is just run into the wall and stop.  The next tutorial
// will focus on sliding, as well as AABB collision checks.
//
// For more information on collision with Quake3 you can check out:
//
// http://www.nathanostgard.com/tutorials/quake3/collision/
//
// I want to thanks Nathan Ostgard, Frank Puig Placeres (fpuig2003@yahoo.com) and
// Gabriel Gambetta (Gabriel@MysteryStudio.com) for their input and guidance on
// the BSP collision.  You can contact them to answer any further questions you might have.
//
// Good luck on your projects!
