/*
In this tutorial we added a rotation matrix that is created from the Yaw and Pitch and is used
to generate the camera's view vector and view matrix.  This camera class can now enable the
user to rotate the view right and left by using the LEFT/RIGHT or A/D keys, and then move
forward in that new direction.  Review the GetRotationMatrix() function to first see how to
create a rotation matrix from the Yaw and Pitch angles (in radians).  Then review the GetView(),
GetViewMatrix() and GetUp() to see how to use that rotation matrix to calculate the camera
vectors and final view matrix that is used by our Models.

    // of Pitch, this is a rotation along the x-axis so we use vec3(1, 0, 0).

    // what we are looking at so it knows what and where to draw on the screen.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This is our Camera class which controls the user's view in the 3D world.  In
// this tutorial we added the ability to rotate the camera left or right by
// changing the yaw (y-axis rotation) and building a rotation matrix.  This matrix
// is used to determine our current view vector in GetView() and up vector in
// GetUp().  We also use the rotation matrix to build our final view matrix that
// is passed to the shaders so OpenGL knows how to render the scene according to
// the camera's position.
