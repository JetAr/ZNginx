Building off of our previous camera tutorial that showed how to move a camera along a view
vector, in this tutorial we make it more useful by adding rotations to the camera.  This
means that if the user hits the LEFT/RIGHT or A/D keys the camera will rotate the view in
that direction.  To do this we need to build a rotation matrix from our Yaw and Pitch angles
and use that matrix to give us our newly rotated view vector.  Previously we were just looking
straight down the negative z-axis, but now when we rotate left or right we change our Yaw
value and then need to recalculate the view vector and then build a final view matrix to pass
to our shaders.  In the last tutorial the view matrix was just an inversed translation matrix,
but now we need to combine that with our rotation matrix to produce a final view matrix.  You
will notice we added an extra triangle behind the camera so when you rotate you can see
something behind you as well.

*Rotation matrix*
There important part of this tutorial is the mathematics used to create a rotation matrix
and then how to use the inverse of that matrix to generate rotated vectors for our view and
up vector.  To build a rotation matrix we first create an identity matrix and then use the
glm::rotate() functions to set the rotations for each axis.  For the case of Pitch we pass
in our pitch and the x-axis:

mat4 rotationMatrix(1.0f);
rotationMatrix = rotate(rotationMatrix, Pitch, vec3(1, 0, 0));

For the case of Yaw, we pass in our Yaw rotation angle and y-axis:

rotationMatrix = rotate(rotationMatrix, Yaw, vec3(0, 1, 0));

Each call to rotate() will keep adding more rotations to the matrix and return the new
matrix with the applied rotation.  Nothing too difficult to understand, thanks to the
glm functions.  If you are interested in the actual math used you can look at our legacy
OpenGL tutorials as we do this manually.

*Calculate view and up vector from rotation matrix*
Now to recap on the abstraction of our view vector from our rotation matrix, we can simply
take the inverse of our rotation matrix and then multiply that by the default view vector
looking down the -z-axis and get the rotated vector:

vec4 viewVector = inverse(GetRotationMatrix()) * vec4(0, 0, -1, 1);

The same thing works for the up vector, which in our case since we aren't changing the pitch
will stay pointing up:

vec4 upVector = inverse(GetRotationMatrix()) * vec4(0, 1, 0, 1);

*Input for rotation*
Since we already had the LEFT/RIGHT and A/D keys mapped from the previous tutorial, we just
needed to add a switch statement for those in our InputManager::KeyPressed() function.  When
those keys are pressed we just call SetYaw() with our rotation speed and time slice, as well
as the direction.  When we turn left we subtract the rotation speed:

Camera->SetYaw(Camera->GetYaw() - Camera->GetRotationSpeed() * TimeManager::Instance().DeltaTime);

And if we turn right we add the rotation speed:

Camera->SetYaw(Camera->GetYaw() + Camera->GetRotationSpeed() * TimeManager::Instance().DeltaTime);

In the next tutorial we will show how to create a first person shooter camera where the view
is controlled by the mouse.  Later we will also add strafing and a third-person camera view.
