//
// This is the 6th tutorial of our Quake 3 BSP Loader series.  This is the 3rd
// last version of our BSP collision detection series.  In this version we add
// simple gravity, the ability to jump, as well as walk up stairs and slopes.  Up
// to this point we go fly around our BSP levels, but in this tutorial we take out
// movement along the Y-Axis by the view vector.  Now, we will be constantly be
// pushed to the ground by gravity.
//
// * How Does Gravity Work? *
//
// This is easy, just keep subtracting a gravity value to the Position.y of the
// camera (or player position).  Since we will collide with the ground, we just use
// collision detection to not let us go through the floor.  This way of doign gravity
// is simple of course.  We don't do any complex stuff.  The true equation for gravity
// is:  newY = ut + 1/2gt^2;  which means:
//
// newY = initialVelocity * time + 0.5 * gravity * (time * time);
//
// For the simple effect that we are looking for, you don't need to use this rigidly.
// However, we encorporate the "time" into our time base movement with g_FrameInterval.
// A true gravity (acceleration) is 9.8, which is why we chose 9.8 for the gravity.
//
// * How Does Jumping Work? *
//
// Jumping is also very simple.  We assign a velocity vector to our camera.  The gravity
// is always adding to this velocity vector.  The camera (or player) position is always
// adding this velocity vector to itself.  When the user presses the space bar, we just
// set the velocity vector's to a high acceleration, which will continue to be added to the
// camera position.  Our jump velocity is 4 (kJumpAcceleration).  Now, the camera will
// be adding a Y velocity of 4 every frame.  So won't the player eventually hit the cieling?
// Yes, UNLESS we apply gravity to that velocity vector.  The gravity is not applied
// directly to the camera (or player) position, but subtracted from the velocity vector.
// That means the velocity of 4 that is been added every frame will eventually turn to
// a negative velocity, bringing the player back down to the ground.  Simple huh?
//
// * Okay, Jumping and Gravity is Cake, But What About This Climbing Steps Business? *
//
// Hmmmm...  I forgot... but I am sure you'll figure it out.  :) *grin*.  Just kidding.
// This is probably the most complex part of the whole thing.  There are many ways to do
// this, but in order to conform to the simple gravity and jumping implementations, I also
// chose any easy method for the climbing of steps/slopes :).  If you notice in Quake,
// when players go up stairs, they "glide" up the stairs.  This means they don't actually
// climb the stairs, but just create some sort of slope type of a path to glide up the stairs.
// I chose to actaully implement climbing of stairs.
//
// We have a kMaxStepHeight that is 10.0f.  This means that we can't climb over anything
// that is above 10 units in our world.  When our AABB collides with something in front of
// us, we set a flag (m_bTryStep) that tells us that we can try to see if we can step over
// the obstacle.  We just do a loop going through 1 to kMaxStepHeight (10) which tries to
// move over the object at each respective heights.  If we collide again, then we increase
// the test step height until either we don't collide, or reach our max step height.  If we
// didn't collide, then we move to that height (we can step!).  Simple huh?  You can think
// of it as a blind person going to a step and just kicking up the step until they reached
// the top of the step and they know they can step because they didn't kick the step at
// that height.  Another method that would cut down checks would be to send a verticle ray
// in from of you down to the bottom of the characters feet (the size of the AABB) and if
// it collided, check the height of the intersection point and see if it's too high for
// you to step.  This is just like a blind person taking a big step with their leg and coming
// down on top of the step.  That should work too :)
//
// That's it!  Not so bad huh?  Of course there is probably many other ways to do these
// methods, but I'll give you some basic ways to implement these effects into your project,
// then you can reasearch more advance methods that will feet your needs.
//
