// This file was build from the Ray Plane Collision tutorial.
// We added 4 new functions to this math file:
//
// This returns the absolute value of the number passed in
// float Absolute(float num);
//
// This tells us if the sphere is in FRONT, BEHIND, or INTERSECTS the plane passed in
// int ClassifySphere(CVector3 &vCenter,
//				      CVector3 &vNormal, CVector3 &vPoint, float radius, float &distance);
//
// This returns true if the sphere intersects the edge line segments of the polygon
// bool EdgeSphereCollision(CVector3 &vPosition,
//							CVector3 vPolygon[], int vertexCount, float radius);
//
// This returns true if our sphere collides with the polygon passed in (Client function)
// bool SpherePolygonCollision(CVector3 vPolygon[], CVector3 &vCenter, float radius);
//
//
// These functions will enable us to check if we intersect a polygon's plane, and then
// more importantly, the polygon itself.  Look down near the bottom of this file to
// see these functions and their explanations.  It's pretty intimidating to look at all
// this code and think that every function is used and needed to perform sphere collision
// isn't it?  It is a really bad idea to just copy and paste these functions into your
// own code and never understand what they all do and why.  It is imperative that you
// know what EACH one of these functions does.  If you want to do 3D graphics, you will
// have pretty poor games if you don't have decent collision detection and know how
// to adapt it to your needs.

bool SpherePolygonCollision(CVector3 vPolygon[],
                            CVector3 &vCenter, int vertexCount, float radius)
{
    // This function is the only function we need to call for testing if a sphere
    // collides with a polygon.  The rest are just helper functions called within here.
    // The theory is actually quite difficult to understand, especially if you are
    // a beginner to collision detection and are following the tutorials in order, but
    // I will try to be as gentle and descriptive as possible.  Let go!
    // Basically, here is the overview:
    //
    // 1) First you want to check if the sphere collides with the polygon's plane.
    //    Remember, that planes are infinite and you could be 500 units from the
    //    polygon and it's still going to trigger this first test.  We want to
    //    write a function that classifies the sphere.  Either it's completely
    //    in front of the plane (the side the normal is on), intersecting the
    //    plane or completely behind the plane.  Got it so far?  We created a
    //    function called ClassifySphere() that returns BEHIND, FRONT or INTERSECTS.
    //    If ClassifySphere() returns INTERSECTS, then we move on to step 2, otherwise
    //    we did not collide with the polygon.
    //
    // 2) The second step is to get an intersection point right in front of the sphere.
    //    This one of the tricky parts.  We know that once we have an intersection point
    //    on the plane of the polygon, we just need to use the InsidePolygon() function
    //    to see if that point is inside the dimensions of the polygon, just like we
    //    did with the Ray to Polygon Collision tutorial.  So, how do we get the point
    //    of intersection?  It's not as simple as it might sound.  Since a sphere infinite
    //    points, there would be a million points that it collided at.  You can't just
    //    draw a ray in the direction the sphere was moving because it could have just
    //    nicked the bottom of the polygon and your ray would find an intersection
    //    point that is outside of the polygon.  Well, it turns out that we need to
    //    first try and give it a shot.  We will try the first attempt a different way though.
    //    We know that we can find the normal vector of the polygon, which in essence
    //    tells us the direction that the polygon is facing.  From ClassifyPoly(),
    //	  it also returns the distance the center our sphere is from the plane.  That
    //    means we have a distance our sphere center is from the plane, and the normal
    //    tells us the direction the plane is in.  If we multiply the normal by the
    //    distance from the plane we get an offset.  This offset can then be subtracted
    //    from the center of the sphere.  Believe it or not, but we now have a position
    //    on the plane in the direction of the plane.  Usually, this intersection points
    //    works fine, but if we get around the edges of the polygon, this does not work.
    //    What we just did is also called "projecting the center of the sphere onto the plane".
    //    Another way to do this is to shoot out a ray from the center of the sphere in
    //    the opposite direction of the normal, then we find the intersection of that line
    //    and the plane.  My way just takes 3 multiplies and a subtraction.  You choose.
    //
    // 3) Once we have our psuedo intersection point, we just pass it into InsidePolygon(),
    //    along with the polygon vertices and the vertex count.  This will then return
    //    true if the intersection point was inside of the polygon, otherwise false.
    //    Remember, just because this returns false doesn't mean we stop there!  If
    //    we didn't collide yet, we need to skip to step 4.
    //
    // 4) If we get here, it's assumed that we tried our intersection point and it
    //    wasn't in the polygon's perimeter.  No fear!  There is hope!  If we get to step
    //    4, that's means that our center point is outside of the polygon's perimeter. Since
    //    we are dealing with a sphere, we could still be colliding because of the sphere's radius.
    //	  This last check requires us to find the point on each of the polygon's edges that
    //    is closest to the sphere's center.  We have a tutorial on finding this, so make sure
    //    you have read it or are comfortable with the concept.  If we are dealing with a
    //    triangle, we go through every side and get an edge vector, and calculate the closest
    //    point on those lines to our sphere's center.  After getting each closest point, we
    //    calculate the distance that point is from our sphere center.  If the distance is
    //    less than the radius of the sphere, there was a collision.  This way is pretty fast.
    //    You don't need to calculate all three sides evey time, since the first closest point's
    //    distance could be less than the radius and you return "true".
    //
    // That's the overview, *phew!*.  I bet you are reading this just wanting to cry because
    // that seems like so much math and theory to digest, so the code must be atrocious!
    // Well, you are partially right :)  It's not that bad actually, quite straight forward.
    // I will label the steps in the code so you can go back and forth to the overview and code.
    // I might mention that by having our CVector3 class operator overloaded it cuts down the
    // code tremendously.  If you are confused with this concept of C++, just create functions
    // to add, subtract and multiply vectors or scalars together.
    //

    // 1) STEP ONE - Finding the sphere's classification

    // Let's use our Normal() function to return us the normal to this polygon
    CVector3 vNormal = Normal(vPolygon);

    // This will store the distance our sphere is from the plane
    float distance = 0.0f;

    // This is where we determine if the sphere is in FRONT, BEHIND, or INTERSECTS the plane
    // of the polygon.  We pass is our sphere center, the polygon's normal, a point on
    // the plane (vertex), the sphere's radius and an empty float to fill the distance with.
    int classification = ClassifySphere(vCenter, vNormal, vPolygon[0], radius, distance);

    // If the sphere intersects the polygon's plane, then we need to check further,
    // otherwise the sphere did NOT intersect the polygon.  Pretty fast so far huh?
    if(classification == INTERSECTS)
    {
        // 2) STEP TWO - Finding the psuedo intersection point on the plane

        // Now we want to project the sphere's center onto the polygon's plane,
        // in the direction of the normal.  This is done by multiplying the "normal"
        // by the "distance" the sphere center is from the plane.  We got the distance
        // from the ClassifySphere() function call up above.  2 return values were given

    // We need this for the distance formula below.

    // Here we use the famous distance formula to find the distance the center point
    // of the sphere is from the polygon's plane.

    distance = (vNormal.x * vCenter.x + vNormal.y * vCenter.y + vNormal.z * vCenter.z + d);

    // Now we query the information just gathered.  Here is how Sphere Plane Collision works:
    // If the distance the center is from the plane is less than the radius of the sphere,
    // we know that it must be intersecting the plane.  We take the absolute value of the
    // distance when we do this check because once the center of the sphere goes behind
    // the polygon, the distance turns into negative numbers (with 0 being that the center
    // is exactly on the plane).  What do I mean when I say "behind" the polygon?  How do
    // we know which side is the front or back side?  Well, the side with the normal pointing
    // out from it is the front side, the other side is the back side.  This is all dependant
    // on the direction the vertices stored.  I recommend drawing them counter-clockwise.
    // if you go clockwise the normal with then point the opposite way and will screw up
    // everything.
    // So, if we want to find if the sphere is in front of the plane, we just make sure
    // the distance is greater than or equal to the radius.  let's say we have a radius
    // of 5, and the distance the center is from the plane is 6; it's obvious that the
    // sphere is 1 unit away from the plane.
    // If the sphere isn't intersecting or in front of the plane, it HAS to be BEHIND it.

    // If the absolute value of the distance we just found is less than the radius,
    // the sphere intersected the plane.
    if(Absolute(distance) < radius)
        return INTERSECTS;
    // Else, if the distance is greater than or equal to the radius, the sphere is
    // completely in FRONT of the plane.
    else if(distance >= radius)
        return FRONT;

    // If the sphere isn't intersecting or in FRONT of the plane, it must be BEHIND
    return BEHIND;

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// If you haven't wrapped yourself around the porcelain god from all of the math,
// you are still reading this and passed!  Okay, so maybe it's a overstatement of
// all the math, but I thought I would make the weenies feel like I identify with
// them..... uh..... just kidding :)  But seriously, this isn't easy stuff to swallow.
//
// I won't attempt to explain everything again because it's taken too many hours to
// comment this baby, but I will go over the steps again:
//
//    1) STEP ONE - Finding the sphere's classification
//
//    2) STEP TWO - Finding the psuedo intersection point on the plane
//
//    3) STEP THREE - Check if the intersection point is inside the polygons perimeter
//
//    4) STEP FOUR - Check the sphere to see if it intersects the polygon edges
//
// It should be quite apparent while looking through this tutorial that there can be
// a bunch of optimizations.  For instance, we tend to calculate the normal and plane
// distances every frame, and also sometimes many times during that same frame.  We
// could precompute this useful information in the beginning of the program
// and pass in more data from our polygon.  It might even be good to create a polygon
// class that has a constructor that computes all this data and store it in the member variables.
// When dealing with thousands of polygons, every little bit helps.  Also, be sure you
// understand that you would not calculate this for every polygon in your world, only
// the polygons near you.  How you find these polygons is your problem :)  I suggest
// an octree or BSP tree, depending on your level/world/scene.
//
// Once again, the next tutorial will demonstrate how to hook this up to our camera
// class and collide and slide against walls in a world.
//
