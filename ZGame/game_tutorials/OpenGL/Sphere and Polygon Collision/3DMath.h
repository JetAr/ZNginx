// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// We added 4 new math functions and 3 new defines to our math library.  Of course,
// it is not an official library as of yet, but eventually it will be.  We still have
// many math functions to add to it before we don't need to alter it anymore.  I
// would assume though, that as you learn more about 3D graphics, this will be
// a never ending process, but for most normal games you will be making, there is
// a time when you got everything you will need.  The rest is most likely specialized.
//
// For sphere-polygon collision, there is only 3 main functions that needed to be added.
// If you have scavenged around the internet, you will notice that this type of collision
// can be very complicated and there are quite a few ways to do it.  This is probably
// the simplest way I found, without having to add a large number of functions.  Be
// sure to check out how to find the closest point on a triangle to the sphere.  Instead
// of using edge plans, this can be a more accurate way of doing sphere-polygon collision.
//
// Check out 3DMath.cpp for the explanations of how these new functions work.
