// This tutorial is built from the "PolygonCollision" tutorial.  Instead of a line
// colliding with a polygon, we now can do better collision that checks to see if
// a sphere collides with a polygon.  The code is modular that it can do triangles
// and quads, or any other convex polygon.  This technique is great for camera
// and world collision.  Since sphere to sphere collision is too simple, as well as
// sphere to plane collision, we will explain both of them in this tutorial.
// What this application does is allow us to move a wire frame sphere around and have
// it run into a triangle.  The sphere will turn green if it is colliding with
// the triangle, while it will be purple when there is no collision.
// Here are the commands to move the sphere and camera position:
//
// LEFT ARROW - Moves the sphere left along it's current plane
// RIGHT ARROW - Moves the sphere right along it's current plane
// UP ARROW - Moves the sphere up along it's current plane
// DOWN ARROW - Moves the sphere down along it's current plane
// F3 - Moves the sphere towards the front of the triangle's plane
// F4 - Moves the sphere towards the back of the triangle's plane
//
// F1 - Rotates the camera left
// F2 - Rotates the camera right
// ESC - Quits the program
//
//
// Sphere and polygon collision is a lot more complicated that you might first assume.
// If you want to jump immediately to the theory, the concepts are explain in the
// * QUICK NOTES * section near the bottom of this file or 3DMath.cpp.  The next
// tutorial will show us how to use this code for our camera class, which will
// allow us to collide and slide into the walls of a world.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// As you can see, using our sphere-polygon collision function is really simple.
// The hard part is actually creating the code underneath it.  To test the collision
// detection, I set up some keys to move the camera and sphere around.  If the
// sphere is colliding with the triangle it will turn green, otherwise it will
// be purple.
//
// You might be thinking, "So how does this help me games?".  Well, this code
// is perfect for checking if your character (3rd person view) or camera (1st person view)
// collides with the world.  Eventually, you are going to have to get down to checking
// collision with each polygon, this is a perfect technique.  It's faster than any
// other geometry-polygon collision test that I know of.  Some games, like MDK2
// used a cylinder for their character collision.  This is also another great way.
// An ellipse is another geometric shape that is fast.  Though bounding box checks
// can be slower, these are also still excellent choices, especially if you only
// need to check the front 3 faces of the box.  The next tutorial will show us
// how to create a function for our camera class that checks polygons and collides
// and slides along them.  We will have a little textured world to move around.
// I bet your mouth is drooling already.
//
// Let's take a look at the explanations given in 3DMath.cpp of the theory/math behind
// sphere to polygon collision:
//
// Basically, here is the overview:
//
// 1) First you want to check if the sphere collides with the triangle's plane.
//    Remember, that planes are infinite and you could be 500 units from the
//    polygon and it's still going to trigger this first test.  We want to
//    write a function that classifies the sphere.  Either it's completely
//    in front of the plane (the side the normal is on), intersecting the
//    plane or completely behind the plane.  Got it so far?  We created a
//    function called ClassifySphere() that returns BEHIND, FRONT or INTERSECTS.
//    If ClassifySphere() returns INTERSECTS, then we move on to step 2, otherwise
//    we did not collide with the triangle.
//
// 2) The second step is to get an intersection point right in front of the sphere.
//    This one of the tricky parts.  We know that once we have an intersection point
//    on the plane of the triangle, we just need to use the InsidePolygon() function
//    to see if that point is inside the dimensions of the triangle, just like we
//    did with the Ray to Polygon Collision tutorial.  So, how do we get the point
//    of intersection?  It's not as simple as it might sound.  Since a sphere is
//    infinite, there would be a million points that it collided at.  You can just
//    draw a ray in the direction the sphere was moving because it could have just
//    nicked the bottom of the triangle and your ray would find an intersection
//    point that is outside of the triangle.  Well, it turns out that we need to
//    first try and give it a shot.  We will try the first attempt a different way though.
//    We know that we can find the normal vector of the triangle, which in essence
//    tells us the direction that the triangle is facing.  From ClassifyPoly(),
//	  it also returns the distance the center our sphere is from the plane.  That
//    means we have a distance our sphere center is from the plane, and the normal
//    tells us the direction the plane is in.  If we multiply the normal by the
//    distance from the plane we get an offset.  This offset can then be subtracted
//    from the center of the sphere.  Believe it or not, but we now have a position
//    on the plane in the direction of the plane.  Usually, this intersection points
//    works fine, but if we get around the edges of the polygon, this does not work.
//    What we just did is also called "projecting the center of the sphere onto the plane".
//    Another way to do this is to shoot out a ray from the center of the sphere in
//    the opposite direction of the normal, then we find the intersection of that line
//    and the plane.  My way just takes 3 multiplies and a subtraction.  You choose.
//
// 3) Once we have our psuedo intersection point, we just pass it into InsidePolygon(),
//    along with the triangle vertices and the vertex count.  This will then return
//    true if the intersection point was inside of the triangle, otherwise false.
//    Remember, just because this returns false doesn't mean we stop there!  If
//    we didn't collide yet, we need to skip to step 4.
//
// 4) If we get here, it's assumed that we tried our intersection point and it
//    wasn't in the polygon's perimeter.  No fear!  There is hope!  If we get to step
//    4, that's means that our center point is outside of the polygon's perimeter. Since
//    we are dealing with a sphere, we could still be colliding because of the sphere's radius.
// 	  This last check requires us to find the point on each of the polygon's edges that
//    is closest to the sphere's center.  We have a tutorial on finding this, so make sure
//    you have read it or are comfortable with the concept.  If we are dealing with a
//    triangle, we go through every side and get an edge vector, and calculate the closest
//    point on those lines to our sphere's center.  After getting each closest point, we
//    calculate the distance that point is from our sphere center.  If the distance is
//    less than the radius of the sphere, there was a collision.  This way is pretty fast.
//    You don't need to calculate all three sides evey time, since the first closest point's
//    distance could be less than the radius and you return "true".
//
//
// Quite a bit of theory, but not too bad.  Once again, the next tutorial will
// demonstrate how to hook this up to our camera class and collide and slide against
// walls in a world. Check it out at www.GameTutorials.com - You won't find any place like it!
//
// I would like to thank Paul Nettle for the collision detection idea.  If you want a great
// tutorial on collision detection, check out http://www.fluidstudios.com/publications.html.
// I thuroughly enjoyed the tutorial on "Generic Collision Detection for Games Using Ellipsoids".
// This provides a great visual tutorial on this topic as well.  I highly recommend it!
