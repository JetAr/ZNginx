// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial creates a bezier curve and allows a sphere to move along it
// with the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.  You will also note that we display
// 2 of the curve control points to get a better visualization of what is going on.
//
// Here is the equation we are using:
//
// B(t) = P1 * ( 1 - t )^3 + P2 * 3 * t * ( 1 - t )^2 + P3 * 3 * t^2 * ( 1 - t ) + P4 * t^3
//
// This is pretty straight forward, even though it looks complicated. If you got
// up to Trig, you will notice that this is a polynomial.  That is what a curve is.
// "t" is the time from 0 to 1.  You could also think of it as the distance along the
// curve, because that is really what it is.  P1 - P4 are the 4 control points.
// They each have an (x, y, z) associated with them.  P1 is the starting point. P2 is
// the first control point, P3 is the second control point, and P4 is the end point of the
// curve.  You will hear that this is a 4 control point equation. I usually think of it
// as 2 control points because the 2 end points are just the start and end of the curve.
//
// Bezier curves are awesome.  You can use them to make realistic camera movements.
// Tunnel effects most frequently use bezier curves to shape the tunnel.  Once you
// understand one single bezier curve, you can then branch off and learn how to create
// curved surfaces.  This will also prepare you to learn about NURBS and SPLINES.
//
// I would like to thank Paul Bourke at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/curves/bezier/
//
// His web site helped TREMENDOUSLY with understanding Bezier Curves, as well as his source code.
// I suggest checking it out because it has a HUGE range of other graphics programming topics.
//
// Once again, go to http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/curves/bezier/ to get a more clear
// understanding of the math behind Bezier Curves as well as excellent visual examples.
//
// Good Luck!
