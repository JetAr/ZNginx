// This tutorial shows you how to create a bezier curve.  This is a VERY handy
// bit of knowledge to have, especially as we see how popular curved surfaces
// in games are becoming (starting with Quake).  Some examples of when we would
// use a curve is for Tunnels, camera movements, etc... To demonstrate using a bezier
// curve, we will create a sphere that we can use the RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys
// to move a across a rendered curve.  Creating a bezier curve is simple, but
// the math at first can be intimidating.  Basically, a bezier curve has at least
// 3 points.  The first point is the starting point of the curve.  The second point
// is the control point of the curve.  A control point "controls" the arc of the curve.
// The third point is the end point of the curve.  In this tutorial we will use 4 control
// points (including the start and end point).  The first and last point will be where
// the curve starts and stops, and the middle 2 points will be used to shape the curve.
//

#define BALL_SPEED	0.02f								// This is how fast our camera moves
#define MAX_STEPS   25.0f								// This is the amount of steps we want to draw the curve

// We create a class that has an X, Y and Z.  We will use this point class
// to store our XYZ points of the curve.

struct CVector3 										// Remember, we use a C in front to show it's a class
{
public:
    float x, y, z;										// We just want a float for a X Y and Z.
};

float g_CurrentTime = 0.0f;								// This is the current position of the sphere along the curve (0 to 1)

CVector3 g_vStartPoint    = {-4,  0,  0};				// This is the starting point of the curve
CVector3 g_vControlPoint1 = {-2,  3,  2};				// This is the first control point of the curve
CVector3 g_vControlPoint2 = { 2, -3, -2};				// This is the second control point of the curve
CVector3 g_vEndPoint	  = { 4,  0,  0};				// This is the end point of the curve

    // 0 being the beginning of the curve, and 1 being the end, we divide
    // 1 by the amount of steps we want to draw the curve. Basically the

    // steps, the curve would be created out of 4 lines.  The lowest the
    // the amount of steps to make the curve is 3.  Otherwise it is just
    // a straight line.  The more steps, the more rounded the curve is.

    // Since we are using line strips, we need to go past the end point by 1 step.

        // in 0 for t, we should get the starting point of the curve, if we pass in
        // 1 for t, we should get the end point of the curve.  So anything in between
        // 0 and 1 will be another point along the curve (IE, .5 would be a point halfway

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial creates a bezier curve and allows a sphere to move along it
// with the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.  You will also note that we display
// 2 of the curve control points to get a better visualization of what is going on.
//
// Here is the equation we are using:
//
// B(t) = P1 * ( 1 - t )^3 + P2 * 3 * t * ( 1 - t )^2 + P3 * 3 * t^2 * ( 1 - t ) + P4 * t^3
//
// This is pretty straight forward, even though it looks complicated. If you got
// up to Trig, you will notice that this is a polynomial.  That is what a curve is.
// "t" is the time from 0 to 1.  You could also think of it as the distance along the
// curve, because that is really what it is.  P1 - P4 are the 4 control points.
// They each have an (x, y, z) associated with them.  P1 is the starting point. P2 is
// the first control point, P3 is the second control point, and P4 is the end point of the
// curve.  You will hear that this is a 4 control point equation. I usually think of it
// as 2 control points because the 2 end points are just the start and end of the curve.
//
// Bezier curves are awesome.  You can use them to make realistic camera movements.
// Tunnel effects most frequently use bezier curves to shape the tunnel.  Once you
// understand one single bezier curve, you can then branch off and learn how to create
// curved surfaces.  This will also prepare you to learn about NURBS and SPLINES.
//
// I would like to thank Paul Bourke at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/curves/bezier/
//
// His web site helped TREMENDOUSLY with understanding Bezier Curves and his source code.
// I suggest checking it out because it has a HUGE range of other graphics programming topics.
//
// Once again, go to http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/curves/bezier/ to get a more clear
// understanding of the math behind Bezier Curves as well as excellent visual examples.
//
// I would suggest changing the control points around so you could get a better idea of
// how they effect the curve.  The higher the control points are, the higher the arc is.
//
// Good Luck!
