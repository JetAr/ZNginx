// This tutorial will demonstrate how to load a .Md2 file.  This 3D file format
// was created for Quake2 character models with key frame animation.
// If you have any desire to create your own file, I suggest finding MilkShape 3D.
// This program allows you to import and export almost every popular 3D format,
// along with the ability to use it as a modeler.  It's a cheap shareware program,
// you can't beat that!  I chose the .Md2 format after viewing the internet and
// see the countless characters already on the internet for free download.
// This is good news for programmers that don't have art programs or can't
// do any art.  All the animations and weapons are done for you!  This is a
// great start to learning animation as well, since the Quake formats are so
// simple it makes me shed a tear of joy.  This tutorial only loads the model,
// where as the next tutorial will show how to do key frame animation using
// interpolation.  Next, we will tackle skeletal animation with the famous
// Quake3 .Md3 format.  This makes learning animation easy because it isn't
// complicated by a $3000 modeler.  Plus, there are hundreds of models out
// there on the internet to test and put in your own games (with permission of course).
// The best place to find models is at www.planetquake.com.
//
// Since there is no animation for the model, we just have it spinning in the
// center of the screen.  The controls are:
//
// Left Mouse Button - Changes the render mode from normal to wire frame.
// Right Mouse Button - Turns lighting On/Off
// Left Arrow Key - Spins the model to the left
// Right Arrow Key - Spins the model to the right
// Escape - Quits
//
// If you decide to go find models you might find them in a format like .pk3.
// This is just a .zip format, so rename it to .zip and unzip it.  There should
// be .Md2 and texture files.  I think the textures are normally in .pcx, so you
// will have to save them as BMP's to run it in this application.
//
//

#define FILE_NAME  "knight.md2"							// This is the 3D file we will load.
#define TEXTURE_NAME "knight.bmp"						// The model's texture map

UINT g_Texture[MAX_TEXTURES] = {0};						// This holds the texture info, referenced by an ID

CLoadMD2 g_LoadMd2;										// This is MD2 class.  This should go in a good model class.
t3DModel g_3DModel;										// This holds the 3D Model info that we load in

int   g_ViewMode	  = GL_TRIANGLES;					// We want the default drawing mode to be normal

float g_RotateX		  = 0.0f;							// This is the current value at which the model is rotated
float g_RotationSpeed = 0.5f;							// This is the speed that our model rotates.  (-speed rotates left)

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This tutorial shows how to load a .MD2 file.  This is a good addition to an engine.
// In the next tutorial we will show you how to handle the key frame animation.
// I think this is the best and easiest 3D file format I have worked with, especially
// for animation.
//
// * What's An STL (Standard Template Library) Vector? *
// Let me quickly explain the STL vector for those of you who are not familiar with them.
// To use a vector you must include <vector> and use the std namespace: using namespace std;
// A vector is an array based link list.  It allows you to dynamically add and remove nodes.
// This is a template class so it can be a list of ANY type.  To create a vector of type
// "int" you would say:  vector<int> myIntList;
// Now you can add a integer to the dynamic array by saying: myIntList.push_back(10);
// or you can say:  myIntList.push_back(num);.  The more you push back, the larger
// your array gets.  You can index the vector like an array.  myIntList[0] = 0;
// To get rid of a node you use the pop_back() function.  To clear the vector use clear().
// It frees itself so you don't need to worry about it, except if you have data
// structures that need information freed from inside them, like our objects.
//
// Once again I should point out that the coordinate system of OpenGL and .MD2 files are different.
// Since Quake2 Models have the Z-Axis pointing up (strange and ugly I know! :),
// we need to flip the y values with the z values in our vertices.  That way it
// will be normal, with Y pointing up.  Also, because we swap the Y and Z we need to negate
// the Z to make it come out correctly.  This is also explained and done in ReadMd2Data().
//
// I would like to thank Daniel E. Schoenblum <dansch@hops.cs.jhu.edu> for help
// with explaining the file format.
//
// Let me know if this helps you out!
//
// The Quake2 .Md2 file format is owned by ID Software.  This tutorial is being used
// as a teaching tool to help understand model loading and animation.  This should
// not be sold or used under any way for commercial use with out written consent
