// This file handles all of the code needed to load a .3DS file.
// Basically, how it works is, you load a chunk, then you check
// the chunk ID.  Depending on the chunk ID, you load the information
// that is stored in that chunk.  If you do not want to read that information,
// you read past it.  You know how many bytes to read past the chunk because
// every chunk stores the length in bytes of that chunk.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This was a HUGE amount of knowledge and probably the largest tutorial yet!
// In the next tutorial we will show you how to load a text file format called .obj.
// This is the most common 3D file format that almost ANY 3D software will import.
//
// Once again I should point out that the coordinate system of OpenGL and 3DS Max are different.
// Since 3D Studio Max Models with the Z-Axis pointing up (strange and ugly I know! :),
// we need to flip the y values with the z values in our vertices.  That way it
// will be normal, with Y pointing up.  Also, because we swap the Y and Z we need to negate
// the Z to make it come out correctly.  This is also explained and done in ReadVertices().
//
// CHUNKS: What is a chunk anyway?
//
// "The chunk ID is a unique code which identifies the type of data in this chunk
// and also may indicate the existence of subordinate chunks. The chunk length indicates
// the length of following data to be associated with this chunk. Note, this may
// contain more data than just this chunk. If the length of data is greater than that
// needed to fill in the information for the chunk, additional subordinate chunks are
// attached to this chunk immediately following any data needed for this chunk, and
// should be parsed out. These subordinate chunks may themselves contain subordinate chunks.
// Unfortunately, there is no indication of the length of data, which is owned by the current
// chunk, only the total length of data attached to the chunk, which means that the only way
// to parse out subordinate chunks is to know the exact format of the owning chunk. On the
// other hand, if a chunk is unknown, the parsing program can skip the entire chunk and
// subordinate chunks in one jump. " - Jeff Lewis (werewolf@worldgate.com)
//
// In a short amount of words, a chunk is defined this way:
// 2 bytes - Stores the chunk ID (OBJECT, MATERIAL, PRIMARY, etc...)
// 4 bytes - Stores the length of that chunk.  That way you know when that
//           chunk is done and there is a new chunk.
//
// So, to start reading the 3DS file, you read the first 2 bytes of it, then
// the length (using fread()).  It should be the PRIMARY chunk, otherwise it isn't
// a .3DS file.
//
// Below is a list of the order that you will find the chunks and all the know chunks.
// If you go to www.wosit.org you can find a few documents on the 3DS file format.
// You can also take a look at the 3DS Format.rtf that is included with this tutorial.
