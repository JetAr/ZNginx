// *Tutorial Note*
// By reading this tutorial we assume you have looked at the previous octree,
// frustum culling and model loading tutorials.  If not, we strongly recommend it.
//
// This is the third tutorial of the 3 part series on octrees.  The first 2 showed
// how to create an octree, along with incorporating frustum culling to it.  With
// this final part, the octree class will now load in a 3D world from a .3DS file.
// The file format doesn't really matter because all of our loader tutorials
// use the t3DModel structure to store the data, which is passed into the octree
// object to partition.  The octree is completely independent from the model loader.
//
// In the previous tutorials we stored vertices in the end nodes.  This version takes
// a different approach, since we are dealing with a model structure.  Instead of
// storing vertices, we just store face indices.  There are many benefits to this
// method.  The first is that we can easily plug in this data to vertex arrays, which
// increases our efficiency.  The second is that we don't have to recalculate the
// face information when we break up the data into nodes.  In any model loader, you
// are given all the vertices in the model, then for every polygon to render, indices
// into that vertex array.  This makes it so you don't have to store duplicate vertices
// in memory or the 3D file.  Like the first advantage, it allows us to easily render
// the model through vertex arrays.  The last benefit of this method is that we don't
// have to deal with splitting polygons across planes and then perhaps triangulating
// them.
//
// For optimal performance, we will be using display lists and vertex arrays for rendering
// each node.  You really wouldn't want it any other way.  Due to the fact that our world
// isn't as big as a full level you would find in a game, the speed increase that the
// octree provides won't be as noticeable, especially on high end graphics cards.  Keep
// this in mind when working with your own octree implementation.  In my experience, the
// biggest problem is loops and being fill limited.  Sometimes, your problem is getting
// geometry to the screen, it's the amount of pixels that are being drawn to the screen.
// If you make your view port size smaller and you get a significant increase, then
// your bottle neck is fill limited.  For instance, On a TNT2 card, I get about 10 to
// 15 frames more on this tutorial when I change the resolution from 800 x 600 to 640 x 480.
// That is why I set the resolution smaller to increase frame rate.
//
// This application allows you to walk around the world using our camera class.  Intially,
// fog is turned on to give it a cool effect.  You can turn this off to get a better view
// of the world.
//
// The controls are:
//
// Mouse               - Rotates the camera's view
// Left Mouse Button   - Changes the Render mode from normal to wire frame.
// Right Mouse Button  - Turns lighting On/Off
// Up    Arrow Key | W - Moves the camera along the view vector
// Down  Arrow Key | S - Moves the camera opposite the view vector
// F				   - Turns fog on/off
// Space Bar		   - Turns on/off the yellow debug lines for the visual node subdivisions
// Escape - Quits

    // The first thing that needs to happen before creating our octree is to find
    // the total width of the initial root node.  Now we pass in our t3DModel object
    // to GetSceneDimensions(), instead of vertices and a vertex count, as done
    // in the last octree tutorials.  This will store the initial root node cube width.
    g_Octree.GetSceneDimensions(&g_World);

    // Since our model structures stores multiple objects, we can't easily access the
    // total triangle count in the scene with out manually going through and counting the total.
    // This is what we do below.  With the result, we pass this into our CreateNode() function.
    int TotalTriangleCount = g_Octree.GetSceneTriangleCount(&g_World);

    // To create the first node we need the world data, the total triangle count in the scene,

    // subdivide the rest of the world, according to the global restrictions.
    g_Octree.CreateNode(&g_World, TotalTriangleCount, g_Octree.GetCenter(), g_Octree.GetWidth());

    // The octree should be created by now.  To better increase our efficiency we use display
    // lists for every end node.  This way, we just have to call a display list ID to draw
    // a node, verses the slow loops we normal had.  Vertex arrays are also used to optimize
    // our rendering of the octree.

    // Below we get the display list base ID and store it in the root node.  This should return 1
    // since we don't use display lists anywhere before this.  Notice that we use our global
    // variable that stores our end node count to pass in the total amount of list ID's needed.
    // If you are unfamiliar with displays, basically what you do is section off a certain
    // amount of ID's, and then you are returns a base pointer to the start of those ID's.
    // You can use the ID's from the base pointer to the base pointer ID + the number of
    // ID's that were saved off for that base pointer.  Each of the ID's correspond to a
    // bunch of OpenGL commands.  That means that each end node has it's own ID that
    // corresponds to a bunch of OpenGL commands.  So, for instance, if pass in a bunch
    // of vertices to OpenGL, we can assign this action to a display list.  That way we
    // just call a display list ID to perform that action.  Think of it as a function.
    // You just need to call a function to do a bunch of tasks, which eliminates extra
    // code, and also is saved on the video card for faster processing.
    g_Octree.SetDisplayListID( glGenLists(g_EndNodeCount) );

    // Now we go through every single end node and create a display list for them all.
    // That way, when we draw the end node, we just use it's display list ID to render
    // the node, instead of looping through all the objects and manually give the verts to opengl.
    // The parameters for this function is the node (starting with the root node),
    // the world data and current display list base ID.  The base ID is stored in the root
    // node's ID, so we just pass that in.  The reason we do this is because, if you create
    // other display lists before you create the octree, you don't want to assume the octree
    // ID's go from 1 to the end node count.  By passing in the base ID, we then will add
    // this ID to other nodes.  Right now, when they are created they are assigned the
    // end node count at the time upon creating them.  This will make more sense when looking
    // at the octree code.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// If this tutorial was too much of a jump from the previous tutorials, I apologize.
// I tried to think of people who were advanced and wanted all the optimizations, and
// at the same time try not to lose anyone.  Fog was added just for a cool effect.
// This can actually be used to help speed up the octree.  If you make the fog really
// dense, you can then bring in the near plane for our frustum.  This will make it so
// you can't see so far, which means you won't have to display as many end nodes.
//
// Let's go over the functions that need to be called from the client to make the
// octree work:
//
//  First we need to get the cube's bounding box of the world:
//
//  // Gets the scene dimensions for our entire model
// 	g_Octree.GetSceneDimensions(&g_World);
//
//  Then we need to find our how many polygons make up the world:
//
//  // Returns the whole scene's polygon count
//	g_Octree.GetSceneTriangleCount(&g_World);
//
//  Once we find the polygon count, we can pass that into:
//
//  // This starts with the root node and recursively creates the octree
//	g_Octree.CreateNode(&g_World, TotalTriangleCount, g_Octree.GetCenter(), g_Octree.GetWidth());
//
//  Since we are using display lists, we want to find the display list base ID:
//
//  // This creates and sets the base list ID for all the end nodes
//	g_Octree.SetDisplayListID( glGenLists(g_EndNodeCount) );
//
//  To finally create the display list, we take the base list ID and pass it into:
//
//  //  This recursively creates a display list for every end node
//	g_Octree.CreateDisplayList(&g_Octree, &g_World, g_Octree.GetDisplayListID());
//
//  Once the octree is finished, we can finally call our DrawOctree() function in RenderScene():
//
//  // Draw the octree with the root world being passed in, along with the root node.
//  g_Octree.DrawOctree(&g_Octree, &g_World);
//
// I hope this tutorial helps give you ideas for your own octree implementation.  There is
// no one way to do it.  This is just what I came up with.  I will strongly suggest that you
// stick with using vertex arrays if you haven't before.  The impact is huge without them,
// especially when you get up to rendering thousands of polygons.
//
// I would like to thank Elmar Moelzer <moelzere@aon.at> for the Park.3ds art.  You can visit
// his company's page for more cool art and game oriented stuff.  He is pretty amazing!
// It is located at www.mediastudio-graz.com.
