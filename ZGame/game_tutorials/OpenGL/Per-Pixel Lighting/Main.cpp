// This is the next tutorial in our GLSL shader tutorial series.  Previously
// we learned how to create lighting with basic ambient and diffuse lighting.
// In this tutorial we will go the extra step and do per-pixel lighting with
// the added specular lighting.  The code is 99% the same as the previous
// tutorial, except for the shaders.  Last time we did vertex lighting in
// our vertex shader, but now we will go over using the fragment shader that
// will produce a per-pixel effect.
//
// * What is per-pixel lighting? *
//
// This might come as a surprise to you, but per-pixel lighting is lighting
// every geometry-rendered pixel on the screen :)  Of course, we don't light
// the background, but all the pixels associated with rendered primitives like
// objects, triangles, quads, etc.  If you want to see the difference of vertex
// and per-pixel lighting I suggest you look at our per-pixel lighting tutorial
// in the Direct3D section, which shows a side-by-side example of the difference
// between vertex and per-pixel lighting.  Another way to see the difference is
// to go into the last tutorial and set the quadric sphere detail to (5,5) instead
// of (75,75).  You will notice the banding that originates from each vertex.
// Then do the same thing for this tutorial and notice that the specular lighting
// is not effected from the detail of the sphere, but has obvious per-pixel
// lighting.
//
// * What is specular lighting? *
//
// Just as a refresher, specular lighting is the brightest light that shows a
// reflection of the light source, usually white.  Ambient lighting is the color
// of the absence of direct light on an object.  Diffuse light is the normal color
// of the light source.  Specular lighting is a great effect because it makes the
// lighting look more realistic.
//
// When you run the program you will see 2 spheres.  One sphere represents the
// moving light, and the larger sphere is what is being lit.  If you look
// at the bottom of this file you will find a line-by-line description of
// the lighting shader.  The shaders in this lesson are a bit more complicated
// than previous tutorials, but still moderately simple.
//
// Keep in mind that we do not take into account the material properties
// of each vertex.  You can add that if you want, you just multiply the
// diffuse color by gl_FrontMaterial.diffuse in the shader.  We don't set
// any of those OpenGL properties in this tutorial so I didn't use it.
//
// If you have already gone through the previous lighting tutorial, then
// you don't need to look through much of the code, since we just add 2
// lines of code to input our specular light color to OpenGL.  You can
// pretty much just jump right down to the bottom of this file to look
// through the explanations on the vertex and fragment shader.
//

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Can you tell the difference between specular and no specular lighting?
// I'll give a quick review of what this tutorial did.  Like the last lighting
// tutorial, we have 2 spheres, one is the small moving light, and the larger
// sphere is the sphere that receives and demonstrates the lighting.  We moved
// away from the vertex lighting and added per-pixel lighting in the fragment
// shader.
//
// Now let's go through the vertex shader line-by-line and explain the lighting
// equations we used.
//
// * LightingII.vert shader file explanation *

/*

varying vec3 normal, lightDir, halfVector;

void main()
{
	vec4 eyePos;

	normal = normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);

	worldPos = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
	lightDir = normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position - worldPos));

	halfVector = normalize(gl_LightSource[0].halfVector.xyz);

	gl_Position = ftransform();
}

*/

// Above is the vertex shader, lightingII.vert.  Before we go over the
// code let's explain really fast how to calculate specular light.  As
// you remember, to calculate the basics of light we take the dot product
// of the light direction/position vector with the normal of the surface.
// We can then know the intensity of the light.  If the value is less than
// 0 then there is no light; however, if it's above 0 then the intensity
// is from 0 to 1.  If the value is one then we have 100% light intensity
// for that area, with 0 or less being no light.
//
// Now the next step is to add more realism by adding specular.  Specular
// is dependent on the eye position of the camera.  Notice how specular
// lighting moves as either the camera, light or model moves.  To calculate
// this we use something called a half vector.  This vector is the vector
// that is halfway between the camera eye vector and the light direction
// vector.  Let's do a quick diagram:
//
//                    L		H	  E
//   L - Light Dir	   \    |    /
//	 H - Half vector	\   |   /
//	 E - Eye Vector		 \  |  /
//						  \ | /
//						   \|/
//                    -------------
//					    (Surface)
//
// In the diagram above we see 3 vectors, the light vector on the surface,
// the eye vector (the direction the camera is facing) and the H vector
// in the middle represents the half vector.  To calculate the half vector
// you just add E + L.  So H = L + E.  We don't need to do that because
// OpenGL already calculates this for us.  The remaining necessary data
// needed is the normal, the specular light color and the shine factor.
// We get the normal from the vertex shader, and we have the specular
// light colors we inputted from OpenGL, but what is the shine factor?
// Basically, the higher the shine factor the less the size of our
// specular light.  You will probably use values like 8, 64 and 128.
// With this data we plug it into the specular lighting equation:
//
// Specular = (Normal dot HalfVector)^Shine * LightSpecular;
//
// We dot the normal and the half vector, then raise that to the
// power of our shine value, then multiply that by the light's specular.
// Of course, if you want certain surfaces to have different
// specular levels you will want to also multiply that result
// by the material specular color, but we don't do that in this lesson.
// With the result we can just add it to our diffuse and ambient colors
// to produce our final color for the current pixel.
//
// Let's explain every line now:
//
