// This file handles all the coded need to load the .3DS file.
// If you haven't seen our .3DS tutorial then we suggest you go
// look at it before tackling the animation tutorial.  You can
// find it at www.GameTutorials.com.  It has more in depth explanations
// of the .3ds loading process.  In this tutorial we added some simple
// animation code.  It loads the key frame information and we just
// interpolate between the translation, scale and rotations to perform
// our animation.  This is VERY simple animation and should eventually
// be turned into skeletal animation with bones.  That is the next
// tutorial.  Remember, this is only object animation, not bone animation.
// If you try and load a model in that has bone animation it won't work.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// This file has support for key frame animation, but is still missing bones.
// Skeletal animation will be in the next tutorial on animation.  This is a HUGE
// concept so this will most likely be done in about 3 seperate tutorials.
//
// * Note *
//
// 3DS max isn't the best program for animation, but It seems to be the most popular
// in the game industry.  This animation tutorial is not the most robust it could be,
// but should be taken as a learning tool to creating a better animation system.  This
// should be a step up to bone animation, which is the BEST way to make cool characters.
// This animation is just objects rotating, scaling and translating.  It is how they
// used to do it back in the 80's early 90's.  So don't try and take a cool model
// and put bones and IK on it, animate it and expect anything to happen :).
// One thing to keep in mind, remember that we IGNORE the frame 0 of the animation.
// If you want to use frame zero for some reason, here is a way that it won't screw up
// the rotation key frames (it saves the rotation of the object for the first frame (0)).
// After you model your scene, before you start animating it, select all the objects,
// go to the heirarchy tab (On the right of the modify tab) and select the button
// called "Transform" under the "Reset" section.  If you don't and you have rotations in
// int the first frame (0), it will screw up the animation.  Please refer to the HTML tutorial
// on how to create this type of animation and the steps to take.  This should always
// accompany that HTML tutorial.  So remember, we want to ignore frame 0 of the animation,
// but if you need to use it, be sure to reset the transforms for every object in your model.
//
// Okay, now that I covered my back :)  Let's start talking about how this works!
// Once again, refer to the .3DS loader tutorial if you are confused on how to do
// the basics of loading data from a .3DS file.  It is at www.GameTutorials.com in
// the OpenGL section.
//
// The basic concepts of key frame animation is this:  You store a position, rotation
// and scale value on certain frames, and it interpolates between that data.  Let's say,
// if you start at frame 0, with a box centered around (0, 0, 0), then go to frame 60
// and center the box around (10, 10, 10), THEN play the animation it should move the
// box from (0, 0, 0) to (10, 10, 10) smoothly.  The same thing works for rotations
// and scales.  You just set "KEY" frames and it does the rest for you.  The weird thing
// with 3DS files is that it saves the position and scale EVERY frame between each key frame,
// buton only saves the rotation values for each key frame.  That means that we still have
// to do the interpolation for the rotation, where we get the position and scale value for
// every frame, so they did the interpolation for us.
//
// So that is all we are doing, just reading in the positions/Scale value for ever frame,
// and if there isn't a new position/scale value for the next frame we just set the rest
// of the position/scale values to the last one.  The same thing with rotations, but we
// first get the key frames rotation degree and axis it's rotation along, inteprolate
// between key frames, then if there is no more rotating we just set the rest of the
// frames rotation degrees to 0.  This should ideally be done with a matrix, where it
// matrix multiplies the rotation degree and axis by the current rotation matrix but
// I didn't want to complicate the tutorial any more.  Any other animation tutorials will
// use matrices.  Instead, I just loop through all the degrees and call glRotatef() for
// every frame that has happened.  That way it's doing the same thing, but less efficient.
//
// There is some data that we ignore in the KEYFRAME chunk, but it will be explained later
// in another tutorial.  This is the jist of it.  Go through the code and read the comments
// around each function to get a more in depth idea of what is going on.  It's pretty basic
// stuff, just a pain to get the data in the format you want it.
//
// I would like to thank www.wosit.org and Terry Caton (tcaton@umr.edu) for his help on this.
