    // When ever we are dealing with arrays, we want to make sure
    // that we don't go outside of them, so we make sure that doesn't
    // happen with a %.  This way x and y will cap out at (MAX_SIZE - 1)

    int x = X % MAP_SIZE;					// Error check our x value

    // otherwise it's the opposite.  Now that we have the correct index,
    // we will return the height in that index.

    // it would draw the columns first (Y), then draw the rows.
    // Notice that we have a STEP_SIZE.  This determines how defined our
    // height map is.  The higher the STEP_SIZE, the more blocky the terrain
    // looks, while the lower it gets, the more rounded it becomes.
    // If we set STEP_SIZE = 1 it would create a vertex for every pixel in the height map.
    // I chose 16 as a decent size.  Anything too much less gets to be insane and slow.
    // Of course, you can increase the number when you get lighting in.
    // Then vertex lighting would cover up the blocky shape.  Instead of lighting,
    // we just put a color value associated with every poly to simplify the tutorial.
    // The higher the polygon, the brighter the color is.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// Though being one of the simplest ways to display terrain from a height map,
// it's a good start.  The next step we would take would be to make a quad tree
// that only displayed the vertices that we could see from our view frustum.
// This would allow us to display large terrains, but not have to push so many polygons.
// This is a form of space partitioning.  There isn't as many good places to learn
// about space partitioning as I would like, but the best place is www.GameInstitute.com.
// They have an excellent terrain rendering course that deals with all of these problems,
// including line of sight, terrain rendering techniques, adaptable meshes, geomorphing, etc..
//
// Let's go over the steps that we accomplished during this tutorial
//
// 1) First, we need to read the height map from the .raw file.  This is simple because
//    there is no header to a .raw file, it is just the image bits.  This file format
//    isn't what you generally want to use because you have to either know what the
//    size and type are, or guess, but I thought it fitting for this tutorial.
//
// 2) After we read our height map data, we then needed to display it.  This was
//    also a simple function because we are just making QUADS with a set size.
//    I chose to do 16 by 16 quads, but you can change this to what ever you want.
//    With our height map array, we treated it as a 2D array and did 2 for loops
//    to draw each quad for each row and column.  Instead of doing lighting, I
//    just gave each vertex a green intensity. depending on it's height.  This makes
//    the terrain look like there is lighting applied.  This also makes it easier to
//    see the definition in the terrain until lighting and texture maps are applied.
//
//
// That's pretty much it.  As for doing texturing, this would be a good way to do
// texture tiling.  You can go into a paint program and create a blank
// file the size of your height map.  This will allow you to set up your textures
// to see how you want it to look.  Then, make a 2D array that stores an index
// into your texture array, then just bind that texture to the current quad that matches.
// it's X and Y position.  Maybe we will write a tutorial on this.
//
// The other option is to let OpenGL find the texture coordinates for you, or you can
// find them yourself by stretching a texture over the whole thing (which isn't always desirable),
// or wrap it.  Remember, (0, 0) is the top left corner and (1,1) is the bottom right corner.
// You will have to find the ratio you want to wrap it with.  Here is an example:
//
// glTexCoord2f(   (float)x / (float)MAP_SIZE,
//				 - (float)z / (float)MAP_SIZE	);
//
// Make sure you cast integers to floats when necessary otherwise it will truncate it.
// The z is actually the Y value of the height map, but the z value in world coordinates.
// Check out the next height map tutorial to see texturing a height map in action,
// along with rendering the terrain using triangle strips.
//
// Good luck!
