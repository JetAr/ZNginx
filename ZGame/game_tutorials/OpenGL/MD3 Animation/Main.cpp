// This tutorial is the second MD3 tutorial.  In this version we will be able to load and
// animate the Quake3 character using quaternions.    Be sure you have read the MD3 Loader
// and Quaternions tutorial on our site at www.GameTutorials.com in the OpenGL section.
// This tutorial was written assuming you did, which enables us to cut out a ton of comments
// and explanations that can be found in the previous tutorials.  I will leave some comments
// to refresh your memory, but most of the large blocks will be taken out.
//
// Okay, so what's different from this tutorial and the last one?  Well, if you run the
// program you will see that our character is animating.  If you click the right and let
// mouse buttons you can cycle through the torso and leg animations.  The name of the
// animations are also displayed in the title bar.  So the question is, how much of the
// code changed to make this happen?  Unfortunately, it's just a couple simple additions,
// but it isn't a bunch of complicated ones either.  The only complicated code is the
// quaternion code.  As I explained in the first quaternions tutorial, the math is quite
// complex to wrap your head around.  Don't stress out about trying to understand why it works,
// it's sufficient enough to understand the equations needed to perform the desired task.
// It goes without saying that if you do have a desire to delve into the math and proofs,
// you will be a better person for it, for it can only help you.  I will NOT be going over
// the theory or proofs beneath the quaternion equations.  Just get a math book.  I will
// talk more about the quaternions in Md3.cpp.  Here is a address to a really detailed PDF
// file written by Ken Shoemake on quaternions:
//
// http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mbl/cgcourse/wiki/_files/shoemake94.pdf
//
// As well as another great PDF from Magic Software here:
//
// http://www.magic-software.com/Documentation/quat.pdf
//
// One of the most notable changes added to this tutorial is that we now read in the
// animation config file, with the .cfg extension.  Remember from the last tutorial that
// only the torso (upper) and the legs (lower) have animation associated with them.  If you
// want the head to animate, the artist will need to make the head part of the upper.md3 file.
// This is why on some models you will see a small head when you turn on wire frame mode.
// The config file stores all of the animations and their respective frame data.  For example,
// here is a few lines from a config file:
//
//		0	31	0	25		// BOTH_DEATH1
//		31	1	1	25		// BOTH_DEAD1
//		32	35	0	20		// BOTH_DEATH2
//
// These 3 lines indicate 3 animations that both the torso and legs must perform.
// The four numbers in front of the animation name store the starting frame, the ending
// frame, the number of looping frames (ignored) and the frames per second the animation runs.
// In the upper.md3 and the lower.md3, vertex key frames are saved, almost exactly like the
// .MD2 file format is saved.  The first 2 numbers are indices into those key frames, which
// are loading with the vertex array.  They aren't actually indexed directly, but depending
// on the current key frame, you would say:
//
// currentIndex = pModel->currentFrame * pObject->numOfVerts;
//
// Since all the key frames are stored in a 1 dimensional array, we treat it like a 2D
// array by multiplying the current frame by the number of vertices of the model (which
// does not count the key frames, just vertex count for one frame).  That new index is
// used to index into the vertex array of the current model.
//
// There are 3 blocks of animations in the config file.  They are BOTH_*, TORSO_* and LEGS_*.
// This is because the torso model can be doing a different animation that has nothing to do
// with the legs animation.  For instance, the character can be doing a shooting animation,
// while they are jumping, landing, turning, swimming, etc...
//
// It is assumed that by reading this tutorial you understand a decent amount of OpenGL and
// are comfortable with advanced topics.  This is a extremely advanced topic and should not
// be tackled until you get to a certain level of understanding in 3D.  I would recommend
// people who might not be up to that level to try looking at the MD2 Loader and animation.
// This is still an advanced tutorial, but not as complicated.  It only gets harder from here.
// And remember, copy and pasting of code hurts small children in Africa :)
//
// The last notable change from the last tutorial is that we now use a matrix to perform the
// translations and rotations of our model's body parts for animation.  Since we are using
// quaternions, and the fact that the key frame rotations are stored in a 3x3 matrix. this
// is necessary.  The rest of the functions and things added are just smaller helper functions.
//
// Before we get to the code, I would like to remind those who might be lost, to go back to
// the original MD3 Loader tutorial and see if there is an explanation that you missed and was
// taken out of this version.
//
// The controls for this application are:
//
// Right Mouse Click - Cycles through the upper (torso) animations
// Left Mouse Click  - Cycles through the lower (legs) animations
// Left Arrow Key - Spins the model to the left
// Right Arrow Key - Spins the model to the right
// Up Arrow Key - Moves the camera closer to the model
// Right Arrow Key - Moves the camera farther away from the model
// W - Changes the Render mode from normal to wire frame.
// Escape - Quits
//
// * Note * Keep in mind that when you change animations it is not immediately.  It waits to
// finish the current animation that it's on.  This can be changed easily if you read
// the note in IncreaseCharacterAnimation() below.

//
// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// You probably noticed that there wasn't much changed in this file.  Most of the
// changes happened in Md3.cpp.  Since I wrote this tutorial before writing the
// previous tutorial, I was able to eliminate tons of little changes, due to the
// differences that would have been added with the animation.  That way you don't
// need to look at a bunch of changes as much as the additions of code.
//
// Below is a excerpt from Md3.cpp explaining more additions to the previous tutorial:
//
// -----
//
// First of all, we added a basic quaternion class to our tutorial.  This is used
// to take a matrix, convert it to a quaternion, interpolate between another
// quaternion that was converted to a matrix, then turned back into a matrix.
// This is because quaternions are a great way to interpolate between rotations.
// If you wanted to use the glRotatef() and glTranslatef() functions, you would
// want to convert the interpolated quaternion to an axis angle representation,
// which might be less code, but not as useful in the long run.
//
// The next important thing that was added was the interpolation between vertex
// key frames.  We learned earlier (top of Md3.cpp) that not most of the animation
// is done through key frame vertices, not bones.  The only bone animation that is
// done is with the joints that connect the .md3 models together.  The game Half-Life,
// for example, uses a full on skeletal animation.
//
// Also, in this tutorial we added the code to parse the animation config file (.cfg).
// This stores the animation information for each animation.  The order of them are
// important.  For the most part, the config files are the same format.  As discussed
// in the previous MD3 tutorial, there is a few extra things in the config file that
// we don't read in here, such as footstep sounds and initial positions.  The tutorial
// was not designed to be a robust reusable Quake3 character loader, but to teach you
// how it works for the most part.  Other things are extra credit :)
//
// Another important thing was our timing system.  Since we were dealing with multiple
// models that had different frames per second, we needed to add some variables to our
// t3DModel class to hold some things like elapsedTime and the current t value.  This
// way, no static variables had to be created, like in the .MD2 tutorial.
//
// -----
//
// Be sure to check out the top of Md3.cpp for a more detailed explanation of animation
// and interpolation.
//
// Let me know if this helps you out!
