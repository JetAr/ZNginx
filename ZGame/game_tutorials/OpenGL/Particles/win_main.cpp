	Particles and particle emitters are typically responsible for all the kick-nut eye candy you
	see in your favorite games.

	Particles are usually formed one of two ways.  The first way is to texture a quad and billboard
	it so it is always facing the camera.  The second way is to use point sprites which are usually
	implemented as triangle strips or the point primitive.  This tutorial is going to use the first
	method to display it's particles.

	So what makes up a particle?  Well you can have lots of different variables
	but here's what we're going to use:

	Position -- Holds the world coordinates of the center of the particle
	Velocity -- Specifies the direction and speed in which a particle is moving
	Color -- A 32-bit color for the particle
	Size -- The width and height of the particle quad
	Life -- Length of time in seconds of how long a particle is active (ie visible)
	Angle -- An angle of rotation for the particle's UVs
	A Texture -- A class that stores a texture

	Also all of particles are effected by a gravity.  The same gravity applies to
	all particles.  Some other examples of variables you could have with your particle
	are:  wind velocity, fade out time, individual gravity, parent (what object emitted it),
	and so on and so forth.  Ultimately what you do and don't store in your particle is
	up to you.

	To demonstrate this particle madness, this app makes a flame effect.  The orange color
	used for the effect is:  red = 215, green = 115, and blue = 40.  Because of the blend mode
	chosen, the flame effect will look the same as long as the frame buffer color, for each
	component, is less than the color of orange for the particle.  To demonstrate this we slowly
	change the background color.  You notice as the background color approaches a lighter whitish
	color, so does the flame effect.

	Still not crystal clear?  Well what better way to answer all your questions than jumping
	into the thick of the code...

	Particle Rewind --

		Hopefully you've got a first step grasp of what a particle is and you have a
		new insight of how you might go and program your very own particle engine.  A
		few short cuts that this tutorial took should be mentioned.  First, we never
		do any billboarding of the particles.  Since it's the only thing we're drawing and
		we never move the camera, we simply always drawn them in the XY plane.  Second we
		don't have a emitter object.  Robust particle systems, usually contain particles and
		emitters, with the emitter being responsible for the overall particle effect.  And
		last but not least, if we wanted to take advantage of an alpha component with our
		particle, either in the texture of in the color, we'd have to change up how we
		our doing the blending.

		So keep these things in mind when you go to make your own kickin' particle system %)

		If you have any questions regarding particles be sure to post them at:
