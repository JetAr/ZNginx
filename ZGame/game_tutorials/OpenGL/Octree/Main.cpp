// *Tutorial Note*
// It's assumed that you have read or at least understand the camera and
// frustum tutorial. If not, we suggest you review it so you can better understand the
// more important stuff.  Though we do not use the frustum code yet, it is good to know.
//
// This tutorial demonstrates how to create and draw an octree.  What is an octree?
// An octree is tree of nodes that stores vertex information about the scene/level/world.
// The purpose of it is to partition space.  This allows you to check what the camera
// is looking at, then only draw that part of the screen.  If you a huge level or world,
// you don't want to pass OpenGL the vertices every frame right?  The 100's of thousands of
// vertices would really bring your game to a crawl of .02 frames per second.  It's true
// that OpenGL does some of the clipping for you, but it isn't as fast as you can do it
// yourself.  That might sound weird because OpenGL is a BEAST and it was programmed by
// really intelligent SGI guru's right???  Well, the problem isn't with their code, it's
// the fact that you are doing a for/while loop for thousands of vertices every frame.
// Loops are tremendously slow and are on of the main causes of slow applications.  To
// avoid this problem, we need to divide space into a bunch of nodes, then test if we
// are looking at each one of those nodes.  If we are, then we will want to draw them,
// otherwise ignore them.  The whole beauty of an octree is, that you can specify how
// many vertices/triangles that you want to store in each node.  Also be sure to use
// vertex arrays for fast rendering.  That way you avoid the huge slow down of calling
// glVertex*() functions thousands of times per frame.  They also avoid loops.  We
// don't use them in this tutorial.
//
// A node is basically a cube that is responsible for a certain amount of vertices.
// If that cube collides with the frustum (our camera's view) then we render that cube's
// vertices.  If that cube has children nodes, then it does not have any vertices stored
// in it, just children that have vertices (or children that have children that store
// vertices, etc..). This could recurse down forever, except that we have a max level of
// recursion/subdivision and a maximum amount of triangles stored in each node.
// Once a node gets below the maximum amount of triangles it stops subdividing.  Now you
// see why this is exponentionally faster than testing every vertex/triangle to see if
// it's in the frustum.  Testing one cube against the frustum is so much faster than
// testing it's 1000 or so triangles.
//
// The maximum amount of triangles for a node can depend on the size of your scene.
// If you make it too low it could become slow because you have thousands of nodes.
// Doing that much recursion every frame could possibly slow down your frame rate.
// It's always good to start with something like 1000 and then tweak it to find the best
// result that works for your scene/level/world.  Since our Terrain example doesn't have
// a huge amount of triangles in it, I chose to set the max at 100 to get more subdivisions.
// If you refer to the *Quick Notes* down at the bottom I will explain more of the detail
// on exactly how the octree works and how it is created.  There is also a HTML file that
// should be combined with this tutorial to give a more visual explanation on how it works.
//
// Note that this tutorial is the first octree tutorial of a 3 part series.  We
// do not do any frustum culling yet because I didn't want to complicate the octree lesson.
// The next octree tutorial will involve frustum culling, while the last one of this series
// will load a .3ds file that has actual world with texture information.  This will demonstrate
// how to have a more real world approach to octree's with texture and normals information.
//
// This tutorial currently loads a text file full of vertices.  I chose this because though
// it is not realistic, it is the best way not to over complicate the tutorial.  You can
// also easily add your own vertices to it to test your own stuff.  The .raw file was
// created by simply loading in a .3ds file with our .3ds loader code, then instead
// of calling glVertex3f() to render the vertex, there was a fprintf() to print that
// vertex out to a file.  After the first frame we quit the program.  Then you have a
// huge text file full of vertices.

// * QUICK NOTES *
//
// At first an octree (or any space partitioning) can be intimidating.  Once you
// sit down and start coding it, you become to fully understand the wonderful
// benefits and it's simplicity.  If you can create a tree with nodes, you can
// create an octree.  The only complicated part at first might be the splitting
// of polygons that intersect more than one node.  We don't do that in this tutorial
// so it didn't get to complicated and overhauled with code.  It's way to frustrating
// to learn a ton of things at once, instead of the main idea and basic functionality.
// This octree will work fine, except there will possibly be some doubling of vertices
// because we don't split them into separate one.  That is fine, but not idea for a real
// product.  Eventually you want to fix this.  The last octree tutorial will read in
// a fully textured world that will be split correctly.  Also a more modular octree class
// will be created because we are missing UV coordinates, normals, material ID's, and
// more importantly frustum culling.  The next tutorial will tackle the frustum culling.
//
// Let me explain once more briefly the intent of an octree is.  If you have a huge world
// with 10's of thousands of triangles, you don't want to do a for loop and pass those
// all into OpenGL to be rendered.  You only want to pass in the triangles that you can
// see (the camera's view).  To do this, you want to subdivide your world into cubes
// that holds the triangle data for that area/region of the world.  Then, instead of
// checking if every triangle is in your view, you can just check if a cube intersects
// your frustum, meaning it's in the view of your camera.  This is one of the fastest
// way to do this type of space partitioning.  Just one subdivision puts the world
// into 8 cubes which could cut your triangle rendered count down to 1/8 of what it was.
// If just one subdivision could do that, think about 2, 3 or 4 levels of subdivision?
//
// Let's go over the steps to using this octree class.  Once you have your list of vertices
// you can begin.  The first thing you want to do is call this function:
//
// GetSceneDimensions(g_pVertices, g_NumberOfVerts);
//
// This passes in the list of vertices and the vertex count.  This function calculates
// the center point of the world, as well as the width of the cube that is needed to
// create the first node.  Once we have these values stored, we want to create our tree.
// We can call CreateNode() and pass in the starting data for the first node:
//
// CreateNode(g_pVertices, g_NumberOfVerts, g_Octree.GetCenter(), g_Octree.GetWidth());
//
// This takes the vertices, the vertex count, then the starting center and width.
// This will recurse through and create the whole tree, while assigning the vertices
// to the end nodes.  That's it!  You just created the octree.  The last part is drawing
// the octree.  This is simple, you just call:
//
// DrawOctree();
//
// This should be called in your RenderScene() function.  This goes through all the
// nodes until it gets to the end, then it draws the vertices assigned to those end nodes.
// The deconstructor takes care of the clean up by calling DestroyOctree().
//
// The CDebug class has nothing to do with the octree other than the fact that we use
// it to display the nodes visually.  I suggest you keep something like this around so
// you can visualize your subdivided world and get a better idea of how efficient it is.
//
// Be sure to check out the HTML tutorial on the concept of an octree.  It will give
// good visuals on the whole subdivision process so you can get a better grasp of the
// concepts.  That's about it, so enjoy this tutorial and please let us know what you
// do with it.  We are always curious to know where the knowledge goes. :)
//
// Remember, this tutorial is 1 of a 3 part series.  We still have not delved into the
// frustum culling and polygon splitting part of the octree.  Right now your octree does
// you no good.  This just explains on how to create an octree.  Check out the second
// tutorial which focuses on the frustum culling.
