	The latest buzz word in graphics for the past few years is "shaders".  Now days, shaders have
	finally stablized, somewhat, with higher level langauges, specifically HLSL (High Level
	Shader Language) for D3D and GLSL (GL Shader Langauge) for OpenGL.

	This tutorial explains what a shader is and how it works in general.  Then we show
	how to use a simple vertex shader, with an D3D effect file (and explain what that is :)

	First a little history.  Shaders first started with Quake3 and Carmack, the genius that
	he is, implemented them all in software with small text files he called "shaders" to
	manipulate the texture matrix.  The the graphic card makers started allowing shaders
	to be done on the graphics card.  Originally, each graphic card maker had it's own language,
	which started as assembly language, to code the shaders.  Now skipping ahead, as mentioned
	at the top of this tutoiral, the two main languages (though still pretty knew) HLSL and
	GLSL look like they are going to be the future of hardware shaders.

	Now some definitions:

	Shader:		A precompiled piece of code that runs on the GPU and operates on geometry sent to
				it, with the result getting drawn to the screen.

	Fixed Function Pipeline:	This is currently how most D3D apps run.  You set all
								the properties of how something is going to be rendered
								(for instance the view matrix, perspective matrix, vertex lights,
								etc, etc), send it to the video card and it makes it appear
								on the screen.

	Programmable Pipeline:		This is where shaders come in.  Now as a programmer, you have
								full control of how the your vertices go from model space
								to being drawn on the screen.  This means you have to do
								all the matrix multiplies and math calculations, to get from
								A to B.  This happens in the shader.

	Effect File:	This is D3D specific file, usually denoted with a .fx extension.  It
					is a D3D object that seriously helps setting up and executing shaders in
					a D3D app.  Additionally it offers a concept called "techniques".
					Using techniques, you can write a shader multiple ways, and then pick which
					one to use, based on the graphics card running the application.  Very handy
					for PC development.  We'll talk about these in the .fx file.

	Currently, there are two types of shaders, vertex shaders and pixel shaders.  Lets go
	through a quick example to see how they work together.

	Suppose you have a shader associated with drawing a textured quad.  So you send the quad
	(in model space) to the graphics cards and say "draw me".  Since the quad is textured, will
	need a vertex shader and pixel shader to make it display as we would expect.  For each vert
	in the quad (which there would be 4) the shader would run once.  For every pixel that gets
	drawn to the screen (which the number depends on many factors, such as size of the quad)
	the pixel shader would get run once.

	This is currently how it works in the fixed function pipeline, the main difference is you have
	to conform to how the API expects it data and are limited to the API's render states
	to do your effects.  With the power of being able to program how the vertex data gets
	rendered you have a lot more options at your hand.

	So lets get going on THIS tutorial.  What we are going to do is create a simple cube, with
	color at each vertex.  Using exclusively the programmable pipeline, we will render the cube
	and spin around the +Y axis.  So lets get going...

	Shaders are VERY powerful.  Integrating shaders with effect files makes them easy
	to use and manage render state.  Once you get going on shaders, you find that
	linear algebra class you took in high school to become very useful.
