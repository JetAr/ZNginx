/* The plane, the plane!

	A plane is a two-dimensional surface spanned by two linearly independent vectors.
	You can think of it as a piece of notebook paper with each edge extending forever.
	Algerbraically, a plane can be defined as:

		aX + bY + cZ + d = 0

	With:

		(a,b,c) == The unit length normal vector to the plane
		(X,Y,Z) == Any point on the plane
		d == The shortest signed distance from the origin of the coordinate system to the plane

	So with a little algebra we can come up with this definition as well:

		p * n = -d

	To get this definition, first we move d to the other side of the equal sign

		aX + bY + cZ = -d

	Then we rewrite (a,b,c) as 'n' and we rewrite (X,Y,Z) as 'p'.  The dot product between
	two vectors is defined as (A * B) == (A.x * B.x) + (A.y + B.y) + (A.z + B.z), so we can
	rewrite the equation as:

		p * n = -d

	With:

		p == A point on the plane (ie (X,Y,Z))
		n == The unit length normal vector to the plane (ie (a,b,c))
		d == The shortest signed distance from the origin of the coordinate system to the plane
		* == The dot product operation

	An ASCII illustration looks something like this:
