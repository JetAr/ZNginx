	This tutorial is all about matrices.  Now this tutorial will NOT cover all the math
	behind matrices (linear algebra).  However, it will go over some of their uses specifically
	geared towards D3D programming.

	So for starters what really is a matrix (besides a kick-nut movie :) ???
	Well a matrix is a concise, useful, robust way of uniquely representing
	linear transformations.  Yeah but what does that mean?  Well in 3D land there are
	three basic operations that one can do:  translate, rotate, and scale.  A matrix
	allows us to easily do all three.  And on top of that a homogenous matrix (4x4 matrix)
	allows us to do translating, rotating and scaling all in ONE matrix.

	So that's the short explanation of what a matrix is.

	In D3D, there are three main types of matrices:

	D3DMATRIX // This is your standard 4x4 matrix
	D3DXMATRIX // This is the same as D3DMATRIX (notice no X), however it has been decked out
			  // with some C++ operator overloading goodies.  This makes it easier to work with.
	D3DXMATRIXA16 // This is the same as a D3DXMATRIX with the exception that it is 16-byte
				 // aligned.  The reason we care that its 16-byte aligned is because structures
				// in D3D that are 16-byte aligned are significantly faster than ones that are
			   // not.  So basically we want to use this if we want to improve our speed
		      // performance.

	The end result of this tutorial is to get a spinning triangle on the screen, however,
	we'll have to go through a couple of steps (using matrices of course) to get there.

	First we'll be setting up our "projection matrix".  This dictates how 3D coordinates (our
	triangle) is to be projected into 2D coordinates (our computer screen)

	Then we'll need to set up our "view matrix".  This dictates how we want to view our
	3D scene.  Whenever you hear a about a "3D camera" what eventually happens is the
	data associated with that 3D camera is used to create the "view matrix".

	Last but not least, we'll use a matrix to set up our "world matrix".  By changing the
	world matrix we'll be able to spin our triangle.

	Okay, it's time to enter the matrix...

	Well hopefully this tutorial has shed a little light on the subject of matrices.
	As stated early, this tutorial didn't cover the linear algebra behind the matrix.
	It is STRONGLY suggested that if concepts such as "2D projection" and "translating",
	"rotating", "scaling", etc aren't crystal clear, that you snuggle up with your favorite
	linear algebra book for a little one on one session.  You can find books and web links
	that we recommend on the subject of "linear algebra" on the www.GameTutorials.com site.

	Now for those totally intimidated by that last paragraph, 'cause you don't know any math,
	do not fear.  You DO NOT have to be a math whiz to program in 3D.  Having a basic
	understanding of the underlying 3D concepts will though help quicken the pace in which you
	learn 3D.  Now if you want to become a game developer, then yes you HAVE to know 3D math.
	However, you don't have to be a guru at it.  So you don't need a doctorate in math, but
	you do need to understand the concepts and be able to apply the equations (not necessarily
	derive the equations like they make you in school) to achieve different things in 3D.
	This tutorial is a perfect example of that.  Take for instance the "view matrix".  Well
	we didn't have to know any of the math that goes behind making the matrix (and yes there
	is linear algebra being done to create that view matrix).  But what is important is knowing
	what a view matrix represents, how to use it, what function(s) to call to create one,
	and how to change it to achieve the desired result.  So to sum it up, if you're not
	already schooled in 3D math, do yourself a favor and learn a little linear algebra.

	As always, send your questions and comments to the message board at www.GameTutorials.com
