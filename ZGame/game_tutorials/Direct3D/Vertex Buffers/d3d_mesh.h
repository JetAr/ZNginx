/*
	This is our mesh class.  A mesh is a collection of triangle data and other
	properties unique to the triangle data.  Typically a model, lets say a human
	character in a game, is made up of several meshes.  For instance, our human could
	be comprised of a legs mesh, torso mesh and head mesh.

	The following mesh class is very simple and just scratches the surface at the
	complexity of a modern game mesh object.
