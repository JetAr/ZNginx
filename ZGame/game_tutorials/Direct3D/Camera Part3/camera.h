	Our 3rd person camera has three main functions which setup what's it is looking at.  The
	first rotateY(), rotates the look at vector (the camera's local +Z axis) around the world's
	Y axis, which always points in "kWorldUp" (0,1,0) direction.  The next function pitch()
	rotates the camera's view around the camera's local X axis.  Lastly the setTarget() function
	builds the camera's axes based on the camera's eye position and what we want the camera to
	look at (it's target).
