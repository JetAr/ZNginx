	Matrix Math 101

		Before we talk about our matrix class, lets do a quick high-level review of
		matrix math.

		First off, what is a matrix?  Well it's a row by column of numbers.  A square
		matrix is one whose number of rows is equal to the number of columns.  Also
		there is a distinction between ROW matrices and COLUMN matrices.  A row matrix is
		one whose elements are laid out from left to right in row order.  A column matrix
		is one whose elements are laid our from top to bottom in column order.  Here's some
		examples:

		[ 0 1 2 ]				[ 0 3 ]						[ 0  1  2  3  ]
		[ 3 4 5 ]				[ 1 4 ]						[ 4  5  6  7  ]
		[ 6 7 8 ]				[ 2 5 ]						[ 8  9  10 11 ]
															[ 12 13 14 15 ]
		A 3x3 row matrix		A 2x3 column matrix
		Also a square matrix								A 4x4 row matrix
															Also known as a homogenous matrix

		When talking about matrix math, there are three general operations that come to
		mind:  scaling, rotating, and translating.

		Scaling is the process of growing or shrinking something.  So lets say you
		have a list of vertices that make up a triangle.  You could scale the size of
		the triangle by multiplying each vertex by a scale matrix.

		Here's a quick ASCII example:

		 /\						 /\
		/  \ Object A			/  \	Object A scaled larger
	    ====				   /    \
							  /		 \
							  ========

		Rotating is the process of spinning something around an axis.  The mathematical
		formulas for rotation depend on the coordinate system you are using and
		whether you are using a row or column based matrix.  The coordinate system we will
		be using is a left handed coordinate system that looks like this:

	   +Y   +Z
		|   /
		|  /
		| /
		*------- +X

		So imagine you're on a merry-go-around and your using the above coordinate system.  You'd be
		rotating around the +Y axis.  And if you think about the tire on a car centered on the
		above coordinate system, it would be rotating around the +X axis.

		Translation is the process of moving an object in a linear path.  If you have a point
		in 3D space and add a vector to it, you have translated that point to a new point.  Any
		time you move something in a straight line, a translation is taken place.

		That in a nutshell is a high level look at matrix math.

		**NOTE** Matrix math (linear algebra) is much more complex than what is presented here
				 If you truly want to do 3D graphics, you will need to learn some linear
				 algebra.  You don't have to be an Einstein at math, just better than Bart Simpson
				 to do 3D graphics.

/*
	For our matrix class we choose to use a 4x4.  Why 4x4?  Well to simplify the answer, it allows
	us to do scaling, rotation, and translation all in one matrix.  Also, it is what D3D and
	OpenGL natively use, so taking our matrix and massaging it in to the appropriate form for
	whatever 3D API we're using shouldn't be to difficult.
