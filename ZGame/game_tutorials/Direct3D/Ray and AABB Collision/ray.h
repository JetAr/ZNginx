/*
	A ray is defined to be an origin and a direction vector (which extends forever) from
	the origin.   Another way to think of a ray is as a vector from a point A to a point B.
	Typically, a ray's length is thought of to be of half-infinity.  In computer graphics a ray
	has a finite length	making it really a glorified vector.  When an "infinite" ray is desired
	usually a really large number is used for the length which for practical purposes makes it
	seem like the ray is infinitely long.

	Algebraically we deifine a ray like this:

		O + tD

	With:

		O == The origin of the ray
		t == A scalar which represents the "time" traveled along the ray.  Plugging in different
			 't' values will get you different points on the ray.
		D == The direction vector of the ray

	You can easily calculate a ray with two points.  Given point A and point B,
	algerbracially it looks like:

		O = A
		D = Norm(B - A)		**NOTE** Norm() means take the normal of

	Which gives us back the orgianl equation:

		O + tD

	Where 't' will determine how far we have traveled along the ray.  A value of 0.0f for 't'
	puts us at the origin.  A value of 1.0f for 't' puts us as 'D' units away from the origin.

	The ASCII illustration of a ray would look something like this:

	O == Origin
	--> == Direction Vector

	O ------------------------------------------> (and the ray keeps on going...)
