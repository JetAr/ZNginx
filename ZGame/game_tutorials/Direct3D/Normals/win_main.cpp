	Inside of this tutorial we are going to explain what a normal is and why we care
	about 'em.  To kick it off lets start with some definitions:

		Normal:  A vector perpendicular to a surface (perpendicular to a plane)
		Normalized Vector:  A vector with a length of one
		Unit Normal:  A vector perpendicular to a surface with a length of one
		Face Normal:  A normal to a polygon that is pointing "out" from the polygon
					  **NOTE** Assuming a coordinate system of +X to the right, +Y up and
					  +Z into the screen, a vector that pointed "out" would point in the
					  -Z direction (pointing out from the monitor)
		Vertex Normal:  A "normal" to a vertex which is computed by some sort of an average of all of
						the face normals that share the vertex
						**NOTE** Different graphics engine employ different averaging schemes.  The
								 simplest scheme is just taking a direct average of all the face
								 normals.

	You'll see this vocab elsewhere so take a mental note :)  Now lets look at normals
	a little bit deeper.  Imagine we have a plane like this:

	|													   |
	|		A normal to this plane could be this:		<--|
	|													   |


	However this is also a normal to the plane:			|
														|-->
														|

	Any vector that is perpendicular to a plane is a normal to that plane.  The normal can begin
	at any point on the plane and be any length.  This alone doesn't help us too much, but here
	is where the concept of a face normal is introduced.  Imagine now that we have a box:
	 ____												 ____
	|	 |												|	 |
	|	 |		A face normal to the box would be:		|	 |-->
	|____|												|____|

	See how it points "out" from the box.  Usually in games a normal is stored as a unit normal.
	This simplifies equations in which normals are used.  By using normals we can do culling, lighting,
	collisions, decals, projected textures, normal mapping, etc.  While we won't get into how
	normals are utilized in all the previous topics, we will get into how you calculate a normal.

	So without further ado, lets get to the code.

    /*
    	To calculate the normal to a polygon we are going two vectors that make up the
    	edges of the polygon.  But how do we choose these vectors?  Well pay close attention
    	because the following is a HUGE stumbling block for those getting into 3D programming.
    	First the concept of a winding order needs to be introduced.  The winding order of
    	a polygon states in which direction, either clockwise or counterclockwise the vertices
    	are stored in.  A left handed coordinate system (D3D) has it's vertices in a clockwise
    	winding order while a right handed coordinate system (OGL) has it's vertices in a
    	counter-clockwise winding order.

    	The winding order of the vertices determines how you want to create your vectors.
    	If you winding order is clockwise, you want to create your vectors so that the head
    	of the first vector touches the tail of the second vector with a clockwise turn and then
    	cross the second vector with the first.  Vice-versa	for a counter-clockwise winding order.
    	Thus our vectors will be created as so:

    	Vertices of triangle:

    	  2
    	  /\			Create the first vector from vert 0 to vert 1
    	 /  \			Create the second vector from vert 1 to vert 2
    	1----0
    */

    // Create the vectors
    CVector vec1(gTriangle[1].x - gTriangle[0].x,
                 gTriangle[1].y - gTriangle[0].y,
                 gTriangle[1].z - gTriangle[0].z);

    CVector vec2(gTriangle[2].x - gTriangle[1].x,
                 gTriangle[2].y - gTriangle[1].y,
                 gTriangle[2].z - gTriangle[1].z);

    // Compute the normal using the cross product
    // **NOTE** If you change the order in which you cross the vectors, you will
    //			have the normal point in the other direction
    CVector normal = vec1.cross(vec2);

    normal.normalize(); // Make a unit normal

    // Set the verts for the line segment representing the unit normal
    SVertex verts[2] = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, D3DCOLOR_XRGB(255,255,0),
                         normal.x, normal.y, normal.z, D3DCOLOR_XRGB(255,255,0)
                       };

    g3D->renderLine(verts, 2); // Draw the normal
}

// Is this normal?

/*
	Normals are used for a wide number of things in game programming.  When computing
	your normal it is important to know the coordinate system you are using and making
	sure the winding order for your vertices is correct for that coordinate system.
