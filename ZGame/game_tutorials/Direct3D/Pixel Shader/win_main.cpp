	The latest buzz word in graphics for the past few years is "shaders".  Now days, shaders have
	finally stablized, somewhat, with higher level langauges, specifically HLSL (High Level
	Shader Language) for D3D and GLSL (GL Shader Langauge) for OpenGL.

	This tutorial explains what a shader is and how it works in general.  Then we show
	how to use a simple pixel shader, with an D3D effect file (and explain what that is :)

	First a little history.  Shaders first started with Quake3 and Carmack, the genius that
	he is, implemented them all in software with small text files he called "shaders" to
	manipulate the texture matrix.  Next, the graphic card makers started allowing shaders
	to be done on the graphics card.  Originally, each graphic card maker had it's own language,
	which started as assembly language, to code the shaders.  Now skipping ahead, as mentioned
	at the top of this tutoiral, the two main languages (though still pretty new) HLSL and
	GLSL look like they are going to be the future of hardware shaders.

	Now some definitions:

	Shader:		A precompiled piece of code that runs on the GPU and operates on geometry sent to
	it, with the result getting drawn to the screen.

	Fixed Function Pipeline:	This is currently how most D3D apps run.  You set all
	the properties of how something is going to be rendered
	(for instance the view matrix, perspective matrix, vertex lights,
	etc, etc), send it to the video card and it makes it appear
	on the screen.

	Programmable Pipeline:		This is where shaders come in.  Now as a programmer, you have
	full control of how each pixel is rendered to the screen.  This means you have to do
	all the matrix multiplies and math calculations, to get from
	a collection of vertices in model space to a final RGB color drawn to the
	monitor.  All this wonder magic happens in the shader.

	Effect File:	This is D3D specific file, usually denoted with a .fx extension.  It
	is a D3D object that seriously helps setting up and executing shaders in
	a D3D app.  Additionally it offers a concept called "techniques".
	Using techniques, you can write a shader multiple ways, and then pick which
	one to use, based on the graphics card running the application.  Very handy
	for PC development.  We'll talk about these in the .fx file.

	Currently, there are two types of shaders, vertex shaders and pixel shaders.  Lets go
	through a quick example to see how they work together.

	Suppose you have a shader associated with drawing a textured quad.  So you send the quad
	(in model space) to the graphics cards and say "draw me".  Since the quad is textured, will
	need a vertex shader and pixel shader to make it display as we would expect.  For each vert
	in the quad (which there would be 4) the shader would run once.  For every pixel that gets
	drawn to the screen (which the number depends on many factors, such as size of the quad)
	the pixel shader would get run once.

	This is currently how it works in the fixed function pipeline, the main difference is you have
	to conform to how the API wants its data and are limited to the API's rendering states
	to do your special effects.  With the power of being able to program how the vertex/pixel data gets
	rendered to the screen you have an infinite number of options at your hand.  Prepare to exercise
	your new found power!

	Okay, okay general introduction is out of the way.  What does this tutorial do?  It renders
	a spinning, textuerd cube to the screen.  Not rocket science (that's now Carmak's business) but
	a good introduction to pixel shaders.  So lets get going...
