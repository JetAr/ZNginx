<H2>Running CGI scripts</H2>

It is possible to execute external programs and have their output
transmitted to the remote client (and also have input from the clients
sent to the external programs) by virtue of using the Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) protocol.

<P>

By default Phttpd will start an external program using the CGI protocol
if the file is executable and either stored in the <TT>/cgi-bin/</TT>
directory or have a suffix of <TT>.cgi</TT> or <TT>.nph</TT>.

<P>

Such executable programs stored in a users own public directory will
be executed as that user's <EM>uid</EM> and <EM>gid</EM>.
