For what it's worth, you are not the first person to report similar
delays. (And I know that other servers (software that is :-) have
seen similar problems from their users). However, exactly what is
going on I don't know. I don't see that kind of behaviour here
on the servers that I run so it's kind of hard for me to debug this
thing.

Not that I can see...

You want to try to increase the "concurrency" parameter to 100 or
something. (This will allow 100 threads to execute concurrently).
However 20 _should_ be sufficent.

This option only matters for people using Netscape version 2 - which
has a bug when handling small icons/images (actually any small file)
in conjunction with servers supporting the Keepalive feature.
That bug is fixed in Netscape 3.

> I have bumped the backlog parameter to 256 and I do have the kernel jumbo

You might wanna check your "netstat" output, and look for a lot
of sockets in the "TIME_WAIT" state. If this number exceeds the
backlog limit then you'll have problems... Also see if there are
many sockets allocated (2.4 is kind of pessimal when a lot of
sockets are open).

Another thing to check is "netstat -m". Check the "failures"
column. This might indicate that your Solaris kernel is running
of the Streams buffers which will cause all kinds of strange
delays.

You could also try to run "truss" on the Phttpd process when things
are going slow to see what it's doing.

Another thing to try is to check out phttpd/config?connections and
?statistics to see if it has many open connections or has allocated
a lot of memory or something.

Or is this slow response only happening for certain clients, or
to everybody when it occurs?

You might also want to disable IP Path MTU Discovery in your boot
sequence since not everything handles it correctly:

	/usr/sbin/ndd ip_path_mtu_discovery 0

> patch installed on Solaris 2.4... wish I had 2.5.1 though...

Yup. 2.5.1 (and preferable Suns special version of 2.5.1 called "ISS",
which has a much better and faster TCP/IP implementation than the old
Solaris versions) works *much* better when acting as a Web server.
Old 2.4 just has too many strange problems...

Two more things:

	Have you read the "doc/more_tweaking.txt" file that
	is included in the distribution?

	Check "netstat -k" for the stream* lines, look for failures
	there also.
