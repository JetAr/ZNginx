The ASIS module
</H2>

This module is used to transmit files exactly as they are without
adding any
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/">HTTP</A>
headers at all. Ie, it is the responsibility of the
author of the files to make sure that the valid headers all are included.

<H3>Example file (test.asis)</H3>
<PRE>
	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	Content-Type: text/html
	Content-Length: 14

	Hello, World.
</PRE>

<H3>System issues</H3>

Causes the server to close Keep-Alive sockets after the file has been
sent (since it can't depend on the "Content-Length" header being
present and/or correct).

<H3>Configuration options (asis.conf)</H3>

Nothing to configure.
