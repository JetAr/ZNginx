Logging data with Phttpd
</H2>

Phttpd can maintain two log files, one is mainly for external use
(the CERN Common Log compatible "requests" log file), whereas the other
(the NDBM format "counting" log file(s)) is used for internal access
(mainly by the <B>NCSA-HTML</B> modules).
<P>
Both are by default disabled, but can be enabled by specifying the
paths to the log files in <B>phttpd.conf</B> or from the command line.
