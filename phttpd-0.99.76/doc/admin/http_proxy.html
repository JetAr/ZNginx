The HTTP_PROXY module
</H2>

This module handles HTTP Proxy connections.

<H3>System issues</H3>

Causes the server to close Keep-Alive sockets after the file has been
sent (since it can't depend on the "Content-Length" header being
present and/or correct).

<H3>Configuration options (http_proxy.conf)</H3>

Nothing to configure.
