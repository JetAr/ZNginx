The MAP module
</H2>

This module is used to handle ISMAP requests for server-side image maps. It
handles both CERN- and NCSA-style MAP files and it attempts a textual display
of the map if the browser does not support image maps.

<H3>Example file (sample.map)</H3>
The map file contains the shapes and coordinates of the hotzones and the
corresponding URLs. Comments can be included and are marked by the `#'
character. Since the map module displays the map file if the browser does not
support proper coordinates, it is recommended to add descriptive comments
which explain the purpose of each link.

<H3>System issues</H3>

Causes the server to close Keep-Alive sockets after the redirect
has been sent.

<H3>Configuration options (map.conf)</H3>

There is no <code>map.conf</code> file to configure. However, it is a good
idea to add the following lines to the <code>phttpd.conf</code> file:
<PRE>
url-rewrites = {
	/cgi-bin/imagemap/	/%{2-}
}
</PRE>
Many servers make use of separate programs to implement server-side
imagemaps. Image map URLs on such servers always consist of the path to the
imagemap program (e.g. <code>/cgi-bin/imagemap/</code>) and the path to the
acutal map file. In phttpd, server-side image mapping is part of the server
itself and so the URL consists only of the path to the map file. The effect of
adding the above lines to <code>phttpd.conf</code> this is to remove the part
that pertains to the imagemap program. This is really only necessary should a
legacy document still refer to image maps using the old notation.
