<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Kernel Modifications</H2>

The default Solaris 2.4 kernel has a listen() backlog limit
of just 5 connections. This is much too low for a normally
busy WWW server, and it is WAY to low for a busy server.
<P>
I recommend that you use a limit of 32 on a normal server
(up to 1 request/second), and on a very busy server (more
than 1 request/second) use something like 1024.
<P>
You can increase this limit to a maximum of 32 by doing (as root):
<PRE>
	ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32
</PRE>

Please note that Solaris 2.4 by default prohibits you to set this
to anything higher than 32 - but see below for a way to increase this
to 1024. In Solaris 2.5 the max limit will be 1024.
<P>
The "/etc/init.d/phttpd" (etc/phttpd.init) scripts tries to
do this, if the limit is lower than 32, automatically when
starting Phttpd.
<P>
If you need to set it even higher then you must use script
'etc/backlog-bumper.sh'. With that script you can increase the
limit up to 1024. (You must also run this at reboot time of course).
This script is not installed automatically.
