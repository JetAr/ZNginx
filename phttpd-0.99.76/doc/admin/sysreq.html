<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>System Requirements</H2>

In order to run Phttpd you need to have the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A Sun SPARCstation or a PC running the SunSoft Solaris 2.4 operating
    system (or later).
<LI>Atleast 5 MB of free disk space.
<LI>32MB of RAM (or more) is recommended (not that Phttpd needs that much
    but the operating system in itself will be very slow otherwise).
</UL>

If you are using the source distribution of Phttpd then you also need to
have a working C compiler on your system (please note that by default
Solaris 2.4 does not contain such a compiler). Phttpd has been compiled
and tested with the following compilers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Gnu C (GCC) 2.6.3
<LI>SunSoft SPARCompiler/SparcWorks 3.0.1
<LI>Apogee C 3.0
</UL>

On SPARC's running Solaris 2.4 you need to install atleast the following
patches (or later versions thereof):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>101945-34 (Kernel Jumbo Patch)
<LI>102224-06 (Libthread Jumbo Patch)
</UL>

On PC's running Solaris 2.4 you need to apply the corresponding patches:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>101946-12 (Kernel Jumbo Patch)
<LI>102224-05 (Libthread Jumbo Patch)
</UL>
