<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Compiling and Installing Phttpd</H2>

Compiling Phttpd is supposed to be very simple. Just follow the
instructions below:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Unpack the source distribution in a directory on a disk
    with sufficient space available (5MB should be OK).

<LI>Modify the top level "Makefile" so it fits your environment.
    This includes selecting the compiler to use (there are
    sample settings for GCC, Sun's CC and Apogee) and what installation
    root directory to use (defaults to /opt/www).

<LI>Type "make" to compile the server and it's helper modules and programs.

</OL>

If all went well during the compilation then you must switch to the
super user ("root") before continuing, unless your normal user have
write access to the installation directory (in this case you may wish
to ignore the error message from "make install.all" about not being able
to install "/etc/init.d/phttpd") since that is normal in that case).

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Type "make install" or "make install.all" depending on if this is an
    installation over a previous installation, or a first-time installation.

<LI>If you want Phttpd to start automatically at system reboot time, then
    you need to create a link from /etc/rc3.d/S99phttpd to /etc/init.d/phttpd.
</OL>

If you want to be extra sure that the daemon is always running,
and automatically restarted in case it crasches for some reason,
then you can use the "ackpfd" controlling daemon for this purpose.
Modify the /etc/init.d/phttpd script to start Phttpd like this:
<PRE>
	/opt/www/sbin/ackpfd /opt/www/sbin/phttpd -w <other options>
</PRE>
