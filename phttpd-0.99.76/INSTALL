		INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PHTTPD 0.99.*
	--------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operating system:

	Solaris 2.4:
		Please read the section "KERNEL MODIFICATIONS" below about
		how to up the kernel backlog limit. The default limit
		of 5 is *much* too low for busy servers! It will cause
		long accept() syscall delays, and possibly denied
		connection requests occasionally!

	Solaris 2.3:
		You _must_ apply patches 102110-01 (or later), or the
		daemon won't even start (except in debug mode!). There
		are so many other bugs/problems with this OS that I
		_really_ urge you to upgrade to 2.4 ...

		I suppose you also should do something like the
		kernel modifications outline for Solaris 2.4, but I
		don't know anything about how to do that for 2.3


	UnixWare 2:
		You must add "-DUNIXWARE" to the "COMCFLAGS" line.


Machines/hardware:

	PC's	Make sure you specify a large enough "stack-size" in the
		/etc/phttpd.conf file or Phttpd will crash in mysterious
		ways. 'stack-size = 128k' seems to be OK. Only seen on
		Solaris.


Compilers:

	GCC (Gnu C Compiler)	(tested with version 2.6.3)
	SunSoft's SPARCompiler	(tested with version 3.0.1)
	Apogee's C Compiler	(tested with version 3.0)

 
        Make sure you are *NOT* linking with Gnu 'ld' - it won't
        build working shared libraries! You'll notice this error
        (or something similar) when starting Phttpd if you do:
 
           ld.so.1: /public/www/sbin/phttpd: fatal: relocation error:
           symbol not found: debug: referenced in /public/www/modules/dir.so
 


COMPILATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	First, make sure you have the latest version of Phttpd. (See
	the README file for sites distributing Phttpd).

	Second, modify the top level Makefile so it fits your compilation
	environment (there are sample settings for GCC, Sun's CC and Apogee).

	You may also want to change the installation root directory
	(default = /opt/phttpd/) to something else.

	Then type "make".



INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here you can choose between "install" and "install.all". The
	difference is that "install.all" should _only_ be used when
	doing a first-time installation since it overwrites the daemons
	configuration file (/opt/phttpd/etc/phttpd.conf) and the system startup
	script (/etc/init.d/phttpd) so any changes you've made to them
	will be lost. So:

	o Use "make install.all" the first time you compile and install
	  the daemon.

	o Use "make install" all other times.

	If you wish to install in a non-standard location other than
	the default (/opt/phttpd) add "INSTROOT=/your/own/dest/dir" to the
	"make install"/"make install.all" command. For example:

		make INSTROOT=/usr/local/www install

	You'll then need to modify the configuration file
	(/opt/phttpd/etc/phttpd.conf) to point the daemon to the new directory.

	If you want the daemon to automatically start at system boot time,
	add a symbolic link from /etc/rc3.d/S99phttpd to /etc/init.d/phttpd
	like this:

		ln -s /etc/init.d/phttp /etc/rc3.d/S99phttpd

	Check the configuration file (/opt/phttpd/etc/phttpd.conf) for any
	other parameters you may want to change/enable.

	Then you can manually start the daemon by issuing (as "root") the
	command:

		sh /etc/init.d/phttpd start


	If you want to be extra sure that the daemon is always running,
	and automatically restarted in case it crasches for some reason,
	then you can use the "ackpfd" controlling daemon for this purpose.
	Modify the /etc/init.d/phttpd script to start Phttpd like this:

  	 /opt/phttpd/sbin/ackpfd /opt/phttpd/sbin/phttpd -w <other options>



KERNEL PATCHES:

	I recommend that you apply atleast the following patches:

	SPARC/Solaris 2.4:
		102752-01	(thread.h Patch)
		102741-01	(libm SEGV patch)
		101945-45	(Kernel Jumbo Patch)
		101973-24	(Libnsl and ypbind Jumbo Patch)

	x86/Solaris 2.4:
		101946-39	(Kernel Jumbo Patch)
		101974-24	(Libnsl and ypbind Jumbo Patch)

	SPARC/Solaris 2.5:
		103093-08	(Kernel Jumbo Patch)
		103164-06	(Libthread Patch)
		103187-11	(Libnsl and ypbind Jumbo Patch)

	SPARC/Solaris 2.5.1:
		103640-05	(Kernel Patch)
		103612-07	(Libnsl and ypbind Jumbo Patch)

	In gerneral I recommend that you use Solaris 2.5.1, since
	that version is *much* faster than the older versions.


KERNEL MODIFICATIONS:

	The default Solaris 2.4 kernel has a listen() backlog limit
	of just 5 connections. This is much too low for a normally
	busy WWW server, and it is WAY to low for a busy server....

	I recommend that you use a limit of 32 on a normal server
	(up to 1 request/second)

	On a very busy server (more than 1 request/second) use
	something like 512 or so...

	However, note that upping the limit to 512 will increase the
	kernel memory usage!


	You can up this limit to a maximum of 32 by doing (as root):

		ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32

	If you need to set it even higher then you must use script
	'etc/backlog-bumper.sh'. With that script you can up the
	limit up to 1024 (which is the default limit in Solaris 2.5).
	(You must also run this at reboot time of course. This script
	is not normally installed automatically).
