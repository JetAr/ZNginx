Before version 1:

* Remove all usage of rwlocks and semaphores.

* Handle the parsing of CGI POSTed FORMS -> PHTTPD_QUERY_xxx variables,
  just like in the GET case.

* If a CGI script exits directly, without reading anything from stdin
  then it just hangs. (isn't that fixed? Checkme)

* Change the on-the-fly loading of modules to simply load them all
  at startup, and never try to unload them. It simplifies a _lot_
  of things to not have to bother with this junk...

* Move most(all?) of the utility code in "src/phttpd" to "src/lib"
  and make the Phttpd main program, and the modules link to it.
  This should make it easier to catch runtime linking errors in modules.

* At "make install", install the header files and the library into
	$(INSTROOT)/include and $(INSTROOT)/lib

* Support the Posix threads for SGI IRIX, Digital Unix and Linux.

* NCSA-HTML: The "user" command should only output a clickable link if
  the user has a "pub" directory. 

* Autoconf/Configure!!

* Finish and clean up the documentation.


For version 1.1:

* Implement the ppml language (see src/modules/ppml.txt)

* Implement a FCGI module.

* Move the url rewriting and url->path code into separate
  modules.


For version 2:

* Should use Pthreads natively.

* FSCACHE: Should be key'ed on real path, not virtual URL.

* Error and Access logs.

* Implement an eval loop that "evaluates" an URL path, calling
  modules as needed. Should support that a called module returns
  some token that means "continue" evaulation (for example libacl.so
  should be mounted on "/" and transparently handle every URL, using
  ".acl" files in each directory (for example).

* Virtual hosts support (using threads, not separate processes).

	o Must be able to define separate document roots for different
	  local IP addresses.

	o Also the access, authentication & url-rewriting must be
	  handled separately.

* Output nicer error messages in child_process in the CGI module.

* fd_relay(): Optimize away the unneccessary temp buf[] var
  (avoids a lot of calls to memcpy().

* Include support for SSL (using Eric Young's SSLeay package)

* Perhaps the modules should register mountpoints at runtime in the
  base server, ie: remove "url-handlers" from phttpd.conf!

* Some way to handle streams, for example so one can push a
  streams module to convert all output to BASE64-encoded data,
  or handle SSL. Or parse HTML output from CGI scripts without
  having to store it in a temporary file...
